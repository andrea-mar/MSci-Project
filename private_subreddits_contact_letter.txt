Hello, 

My name is Andreea, and I am a data science master's student at Birkbeck College, University of London. My thesis research focuses on prevalent discussion themes within autism Reddit communities. In particular, I'm planning to track the frequency of specific keywords linked to Applied Behavioural Analysis and assess the overall sentiment of discussions revolving around this topic. My aim is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the autism community perceives Applied Behavioural Analysis. I am reaching out to respectfully request permission to join and access the discussions in your private subreddit. 

I understand how crucial privacy and security are in your community, and thus I am committed to maintaining the anonymity and confidentiality of all members. The information gathered will be used strictly for academic purposes. 

In recognition of the trust and sensitivity associated with your community's discussions, I am more than willing to adhere to any guidelines, rules, or protocols that you might have in place for granting access to external researchers. Whether that involves submitting a formal proposal, adhering to ethical guidelines, or any other necessary steps, I am completely open to the process.

Moreover, I promise to share a comprehensive summary of my findings with the subreddit once my research is complete. This way, the community will benefit from the outcomes of my study.

For your reference, my thesis supervisor is Dr. Dimitrios Airantzis. He can be reached at dimitris.airantzis@bbk.ac.uk, in case you require any additional information or reassurance.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of joining your community.

Best regards,


Andreea Nistor
