<p><strong>Microbiome</strong> - &quot;the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space.&quot; This term was originally coined by Joshua Lederberg, who argued the importance of microorganisms inhabiting the human body in health and disease.</p>

<p>The human body contains over 10 times more microbial cells than human cells, although the entire microbiome only weighs about 200 grams (7.1 oz), with some weight estimates ranging as high as 3 pounds (approximately 48 ounces or 1,400 grams). Some consider it to be a &quot;newly discovered organ&quot; since its existence was not generally recognized until the late 1990s and it is understood to potentially have overwhelming impact on human health.[8] Modern DNA sequencing techniques have enabled researchers to find the majority of these microbes, since the majority of them cannot be cultured in a lab using current techniques. </p>

<p>The human microbiome may be implicated in auto-immune diseases like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, and perhaps some cancers. Common obesity might also be aggravated by a poor mix of microbes in the gut. Since some of the microbes in our body can modify the production of neurotransmitters known to be found in the brain, we may also find some relief for schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder and other neuro-chemical imbalances.</p>

<p><strong>Microbiomes</strong> are being characterized in many other environments as well, including soil, seawater and freshwater systems. It is believed that endosymbiosis originally gave rise to more complex organisms, and continued to play a fundamental role in guiding their evolution and expansion into new niches.
The microbes being discussed are generally non-pathogenic (do not cause disease unless they grow abnormally); they exist in harmony and symbiotically with their hosts.</p>

<p>Researchers have learned that much of the population of microbes found in the human body are not bacteria but a very old class of single-celled organisms called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea"">archaea</a>.

The human body contains over 10 times more microbial cells than human cells, although the entire microbiome only weighs about 200 grams (7.1 oz), with some weight estimates ranging as high as 3 pounds (approximately 48 ounces or 1,400 grams). Some consider it to be a ""newly discovered organ"" since its existence was not generally recognized until the late 1990s and it is understood to potentially have overwhelming impact on human health.[8] Modern DNA sequencing techniques have enabled researchers to find the majority of these microbes, since the majority of them cannot be cultured in a lab using current techniques. 

The human microbiome may be implicated in auto-immune diseases like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, and perhaps some cancers. Common obesity might also be aggravated by a poor mix of microbes in the gut. Since some of the microbes in our body can modify the production of neurotransmitters known to be found in the brain, we may also find some relief for schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder and other neuro-chemical imbalances.

**Microbiomes** are being characterized in many other environments as well, including soil, seawater and freshwater systems. It is believed that endosymbiosis originally gave rise to more complex organisms, and continued to play a fundamental role in guiding their evolution and expansion into new niches.
The microbes being discussed are generally non-pathogenic (do not cause disease unless they grow abnormally); they exist in harmony and symbiotically with their hosts.

Researchers have learned that much of the population of microbes found in the human body are not bacteria but a very old class of single-celled organisms called [archaea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea).

<h1>RULES</h1>

<h1><strong>Please Take a Moment To Read The Rules Before Posting</strong></h1>

<p><strong>1) Advice Format.</strong>  This is a subreddit for asking Mechanical questions pertaining to vehicles, engines, etc. If it&#39;s got wheels, treads, floats, flies, or has an engine you&#39;re good to go and we&#39;ll do our best to help. Showing off w/out a question goes in <a href=""/r/justrolledintotheshop"">r/justrolledintotheshop</a> legal/insurance questions go in <a href=""/r/legaladvice"">r/legaladvice</a> or <a href=""/r/insurance"">r/insurance</a>. Title, salvage, body work, paint work, etc questions also dont belong here. Memes, youtube videos and other non questions are not allowed    </p>

<p>No intentionally bad, harmful, or deceptive advice. If we feel a piece of advice is particularly reckless, dangerous, or extremely unhelpful it maybe removed If a post or comment is provided that is not a response to a question, the post may be removed. Please report bad advice to the mod team.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>2) Keep discussion friendly, civil, courteous, and professional.</strong> We&#39;re here to help so being rude won&#39;t help. Dont assume a shop is trying to &quot;rip you off.&quot; It&#39;s okay to ask for a second opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Golden Rule: If you have nothing nice to say, don&#39;t say anything at all.</strong> <strong>Those who demonstrate they cannot follow the rules will be warned and posts removed. Those who continually cause issue will be removed</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>3)</strong> Only one vehicle/problem/incident per thread, and only post once. If you didn&#39;t get an answer the first time, or you don&#39;t like the answer you got that does not mean you post it again. Do not post asking questions of your own in someone else&#39;s post</p>

<p>The only exception is for posting updates, provided it is properly marked as an [Update] or similar.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>4) Spam/Self-Promotion/Improper Linking/advertisements.</strong>  Linking to outside content is not allowed, unless it&#39;s germane to the discussion. We allow links, pictures, video, or audio file to help diagnose your problem. <strong>Linking for the purposes of promotion (eg offers/coupons/self blog posts/youtube/advertisements/how to) is strictly prohibited and will result in a permanent ban. This is a zero tolerance policy.</strong> This isnt a place to post your youtube channel, advertisements, memes, shitposts or business </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>5) Personal Information.</strong>  Sharing personal information, or specifics on <a href=""/r/MechanicAdvice"">/r/MechanicAdvice</a> is not allowed.  Please do not name the shops specifically (unless part of a chain)  This is not a review forum for specific shops.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>6) Body Work.</strong> <a href=""/r/MechanicAdvice"">/r/MechanicAdvice</a>  is a sub for <strong>mechanical</strong> questions. Questions related to dings, dents, accidents, paint and so forth <strong>DO NOT</strong> belong here, please post in <a href=""/r/Autobody"">/r/Autobody</a> <a href=""/r/AutoBodyRepair/"">r/AutoBodyRepair/</a> or <a href=""/r/Diyautobody/"">/r/Diyautobody/</a>  Take the car to an auto body repair shop who can give you a qualified estimate. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Asking for an estimate in <a href=""/r/autobody"">r/autobody</a> is against there rules. If you have insurance/total loss questions please ask in <a href=""/r/insurance"">r/insurance</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<h1>RIP-OFFS, SCAMS, &amp; SECOND OPINIONS</h1>

<p>You may ask a second opinion on a quote/repair from a shop.  However, please observe rule #1 when asking for a second opinion.  It is considered rude to ask, “Is the shop trying to fleece/rip me off?”  You wouldn’t ask “Why are all cops pigs?” on <a href=""/r/AskLeo"">/r/AskLeo</a>, ask about Creationism on <a href=""/r/AskScience"">/r/AskScience</a>, or talk about vaccines causing autism on <a href=""/r/AskDocs"">/r/AskDocs</a>.</p>

<p>Generally there is a good reason why a repair costs what it does.  We are more than happy to help you figure out why a shop wants to charge you for a repair, and we will tell you if it is unusually high.  We are also happy to advise on how you can save money at the shop.  <em>Please read the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/4qblei/fyi_the_shop_isnt_likely_trying_to_rip_you_off/"">sticky post</a> on the subject for details.</em></p>

<hr/>

<h1>IMPORTANT</h1>

<p>Understand that the assistance you receive is <strong>ADVICE ONLY</strong> and is given with the understanding that the giver assumes no liability for any damages that occur as a direct or indirect result. It is impossible for a mechanic to diagnose your problem accurately without seeing/hearing the problem with his own senses. Any advice you receive you must use AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

#RULES

#**Please Take a Moment To Read The Rules Before Posting**

**1) Advice Format.**  This is a subreddit for asking Mechanical questions pertaining to vehicles, engines, etc. If it's got wheels, treads, floats, flies, or has an engine you're good to go and we'll do our best to help. Showing off w/out a question goes in r/justrolledintotheshop legal/insurance questions go in r/legaladvice or r/insurance. Title, salvage, body work, paint work, etc questions also dont belong here. Memes, youtube videos and other non questions are not allowed    

No intentionally bad, harmful, or deceptive advice. If we feel a piece of advice is particularly reckless, dangerous, or extremely unhelpful it maybe removed If a post or comment is provided that is not a response to a question, the post may be removed. Please report bad advice to the mod team.

---

**2) Keep discussion friendly, civil, courteous, and professional.** We're here to help so being rude won't help. Dont assume a shop is trying to ""rip you off."" It's okay to ask for a second opinion.

**Golden Rule: If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all.** **Those who demonstrate they cannot follow the rules will be warned and posts removed. Those who continually cause issue will be removed**

---
**3)** Only one vehicle/problem/incident per thread, and only post once. If you didn't get an answer the first time, or you don't like the answer you got that does not mean you post it again. Do not post asking questions of your own in someone else's post

The only exception is for posting updates, provided it is properly marked as an [Update] or similar.

---
**4) Spam/Self-Promotion/Improper Linking/advertisements.**  Linking to outside content is not allowed, unless it's germane to the discussion. We allow links, pictures, video, or audio file to help diagnose your problem. **Linking for the purposes of promotion (eg offers/coupons/self blog posts/youtube/advertisements/how to) is strictly prohibited and will result in a permanent ban. This is a zero tolerance policy.** This isnt a place to post your youtube channel, advertisements, memes, shitposts or business 

---
**5) Personal Information.**  Sharing personal information, or specifics on /r/MechanicAdvice is not allowed.  Please do not name the shops specifically (unless part of a chain)  This is not a review forum for specific shops.

---
**6) Body Work.** /r/MechanicAdvice  is a sub for **mechanical** questions. Questions related to dings, dents, accidents, paint and so forth **DO NOT** belong here, please post in /r/Autobody r/AutoBodyRepair/ or /r/Diyautobody/  Take the car to an auto body repair shop who can give you a qualified estimate. 

---
Asking for an estimate in r/autobody is against there rules. If you have insurance/total loss questions please ask in r/insurance.

---

#RIP-OFFS, SCAMS, & SECOND OPINIONS

You may ask a second opinion on a quote/repair from a shop.  However, please observe rule #1 when asking for a second opinion.  It is considered rude to ask, “Is the shop trying to fleece/rip me off?”  You wouldn’t ask “Why are all cops pigs?” on /r/AskLeo, ask about Creationism on /r/AskScience, or talk about vaccines causing autism on /r/AskDocs.

Generally there is a good reason why a repair costs what it does.  We are more than happy to help you figure out why a shop wants to charge you for a repair, and we will tell you if it is unusually high.  We are also happy to advise on how you can save money at the shop.  *Please read the [sticky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/4qblei/fyi_the_shop_isnt_likely_trying_to_rip_you_off/) on the subject for details.*

---

#IMPORTANT

Understand that the assistance you receive is **ADVICE ONLY** and is given with the understanding that the giver assumes no liability for any damages that occur as a direct or indirect result. It is impossible for a mechanic to diagnose your problem accurately without seeing/hearing the problem with his own senses. Any advice you receive you must use AT YOUR OWN RISK.

<p>This group is an extension of the Facebook group - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/noisefloorav/"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/noisefloorav/</a></p>

<p>Rules:</p>

<p>1 - The number 1 rule is to always be respectful. Period.</p>

<p>2 - The second rule is to keep an open mind. If you see someone offering a tip that you think is stupid, you can let that be known without being high and mighty about it. Just because you may not do it, doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) be done by someone else.</p>

<p>3 - The third rule is to keep your posts related to the subject of the group, which is audio and video production. This can include all aspects of audio and video production, including the business side of those worlds. However, posts about which album you think is awesome or which band shouldn&#39;t have been on warped tour do not belong on this group. We&#39;re here to have grown up discussions about how to do our jobs.</p>

<p>4 - The fourth rule is that you must respect the fact that this group has professionals who get paid for their time and expertise. Asking if anyone can edit your drum tracks for free is disrespectful to those individuals. If you ask if anyone wants drum tracks to practice editing on, and a newer engineer sees that as an ideal opportunity for them to practice their drum editing skills, that&#39;s perfectly fine. But if you come here and say &quot;I need these drums edited, but I have zero budget. Who can help me?&quot;, I&#39;ll ban you. Those of us who earn our living doing this do not appreciate having our work undermined and disrespected. Be mindful of that.</p>

<p>5 - The 5th rule is that we don&#39;t care about your band. If you post in here that your band just released a new single, and then you walk away without discussing the production of that single, I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re posting band spam and ban you. We&#39;ve all got musical projects we&#39;re working on, and this isn&#39;t the place to promote those projects.</p>

<p>6 - The 6th rule is that you can ask for mix critiques, but if you do ask then be mindful of rule number 4. Many of the people in this group who may have the most valuable input may have very little time to critique your mix. Some of us are willing, but have very little time to do so. So be aware that you run the risk of getting critiques from people who aren&#39;t as experienced in this group if you ask for critiques. We encourage everyone to take part in the discussion, but be mindful of that fact.</p>

<p>7 - The 7th rule is that you are allowed to promote your products here. If you, yourself, had a hand in producing a sample pack or a plugin and you wanna tell us about it, you can do so. Don&#39;t do this too often, as it&#39;ll be looked at as spam. If the only thing you post on this group is an ad for your product over and over again over a period of time, it&#39;ll be clear to us that you&#39;re not trying to contribute to the discussions here and are merely trying to advertise. We&#39;re trying to build a learning community, not another ad wall.</p>

<p>8 - The 8th rule is to understand that I, Brandon S. Hire, will do my best to interact with all of you. However, the demands of raising two teens on the autism spectrum are more important than this forum. I may appear stressed at times, and I may never have time to listen to something you&#39;d like my input on. It&#39;s not personal. Far from it.

<p>With that said, I&#39;m just a guy who has a DAW. Same as you. My aim is to create a group where everyone is treated equally and respectfully. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re Bob Rock, or some teenager who is cutting demos with reaper on a laptop in his bedroom, you&#39;ve both got something in common. You&#39;re humans, and you&#39;re interested in the same thing. You both deserve the same amount of respect, and you will get that in this group if you give it in this group.</p>

</div><!-- SC_ON -->",True,False,new,True,False,False,False,,,,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,restricted,,,,,True,3jt94,,False,,"We're here to discuss all things related to audio and video production, including editing tips and tricks, as well as the industry and the business side of the equation.

This group is an extension of the Facebook group - https://www.facebook.com/groups/noisefloorav/

Rules:

1 - The number 1 rule is to always be respectful. Period.

2 - The second rule is to keep an open mind. If you see someone offering a tip that you think is stupid, you can let that be known without being high and mighty about it. Just because you may not do it, doesn't mean it can't (or shouldn't) be done by someone else.

3 - The third rule is to keep your posts related to the subject of the group, which is audio and video production. This can include all aspects of audio and video production, including the business side of those worlds. However, posts about which album you think is awesome or which band shouldn't have been on warped tour do not belong on this group. We're here to have grown up discussions about how to do our jobs.

4 - The fourth rule is that you must respect the fact that this group has professionals who get paid for their time and expertise. Asking if anyone can edit your drum tracks for free is disrespectful to those individuals. If you ask if anyone wants drum tracks to practice editing on, and a newer engineer sees that as an ideal opportunity for them to practice their drum editing skills, that's perfectly fine. But if you come here and say ""I need these drums edited, but I have zero budget. Who can help me?"", I'll ban you. Those of us who earn our living doing this do not appreciate having our work undermined and disrespected. Be mindful of that.

5 - The 5th rule is that we don't care about your band. If you post in here that your band just released a new single, and then you walk away without discussing the production of that single, I'll assume you're posting band spam and ban you. We've all got musical projects we're working on, and this isn't the place to promote those projects.

6 - The 6th rule is that you can ask for mix critiques, but if you do ask then be mindful of rule number 4. Many of the people in this group who may have the most valuable input may have very little time to critique your mix. Some of us are willing, but have very little time to do so. So be aware that you run the risk of getting critiques from people who aren't as experienced in this group if you ask for critiques. We encourage everyone to take part in the discussion, but be mindful of that fact.

7 - The 7th rule is that you are allowed to promote your products here. If you, yourself, had a hand in producing a sample pack or a plugin and you wanna tell us about it, you can do so. Don't do this too often, as it'll be looked at as spam. If the only thing you post on this group is an ad for your product over and over again over a period of time, it'll be clear to us that you're not trying to contribute to the discussions here and are merely trying to advertise. We're trying to build a learning community, not another ad wall.

8 - The 8th rule is to understand that I, Brandon S. Hire, will do my best to interact with all of you. However, the demands of raising two teens on the autism spectrum are more important than this forum. I may appear stressed at times, and I may never have time to listen to something you'd like my input on. It's not personal. Far from it. I want to interact with all of you, which is why I'm pulling you here. But I've got a lot on my plate, and have priorities that trump Facebook in my personal life. Be respectful of that please.

<p>&quot;Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), previously known as Devic&#39;s disease, is a central nervous system disorder that primarily affects the eye nerves (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis). Now known in broader terms as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, NMO occurs when your body&#39;s immune system reacts against its own cells in the central nervous system, mainly in the optic nerves and spinal cord, but sometimes in the brain.</p>

<p>The cause of neuromyelitis optica is usually unknown, although it may sometimes appear after an infection, or it may be associated with another autoimmune condition. Neuromyelitis optica is often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS) or perceived as a type of MS, but NMO is a distinct condition.&quot; -Mayo Clinic</p>

<p>You should only report a post or comment if you believe it violates our rules or Reddit&#39;s TOS. Do not use the report button as a downvote button.</p>

<p>If a user abuses the report button, we WILL flag their reports, and this very often results in their account being suspended from all of Reddit.</p>

<p>We also recently started a new subReddit: <a href=""/r/SuicidalPeople"">r/SuicidalPeople</a>, similar to <a href=""/r/SuicideWatch"">r/SuicideWatch</a>, but where all types of (non-religious) positive responses are encouraged -- by anyone from therapists to psychiatrists to life coaches to caring individuals who simply want to offer their thoughts, advice or encouragement.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong><em>We&#39;d like to invite</em></strong> suicidologists, suicide researchers, suicide prevention professionals and volunteers, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, students -- and anyone else with an interest in understanding and preventing suicide -- to post and share links and resources HERE, or on our other subReddit: <a href=""/r/AvoidSuicide"">/r/AvoidSuicide</a></p>

<p><em>Know someone in suicide prevention? Share:</em>
<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicidePreventionRes"">www.reddit.com/r/SuicidePreventionRes</a></p>

<p>Also, professionals and volunteers alike are encouraged to respond/relate on <a href=""/r/suicidewatch"">r/suicidewatch</a> or <a href=""/r/SuicidalPeople"">r/SuicidalPeople</a> (our new subReddit). <em>You could help save a life today!</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>Like <a href=""/r/suicidology"">/r/suicidology</a> ... <strong>This subReddit is devoted to understanding and preventing suicide.</strong> </p>

<p>Suicidology is defined as the study of suicide and suicide prevention. However, because some people see suicidology as the objective study of suicide (whether pro or con), the <a href=""/r/suicidology"">/r/suicidology</a> subReddit has had issues with pro-suicide postings, and has had to change their moderation polices to keep it more focused on suicide prevention.</p>

<p>Since this subReddit has the word &#39;prevention&#39; in the title, the hope is that it can remain focused on research and info that helps <strong>prevent suicide</strong>, rather than discussions about the pros and cons or rightness/wrongness of committing suicide. </p>

<p>While there may be nothing inherently &#39;wrong&#39; about an individual choosing to end their life, and the creator/moderator(s) of this subReddit are not taking a position against an individual&#39;s right to die; because the personal issues involved are often very complex; and because it is believed that the majority of suicidal people would much prefer to improve their lives and continue living if that were possible; and because many people who were once extremely suicidal have gone on to live happy, healthy, productive lives; the goal of this subReddit is to do everything possible to encourage people to stay alive and to promote all methods of suicide prevention that may help suicidal people overcome their struggles, rebuild their lives, and ultimately find the peace, happiness and fulfillment that all of us as humans long for.</p>

This subReddit was created by the operator of 
[AvoidSuicide.com](http://AvoidSuicide.com) & [MyLifeIssues.org](http://mylifeissues.org) and the host of the new [Suicide Prevention Podcast](http://SuicidePreventionPodcast.org). 

We also recently started a new subReddit: r/SuicidalPeople, similar to r/SuicideWatch, but where all types of (non-religious) positive responses are encouraged -- by anyone from therapists to psychiatrists to life coaches to caring individuals who simply want to offer their thoughts, advice or encouragement.

**Suicide Prevention Research & Resources**

/r/SuicidePreventionRes

---

***We'd like to invite*** suicidologists, suicide researchers, suicide prevention professionals and volunteers, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, students -- and anyone else with an interest in understanding and preventing suicide -- to post and share links and resources HERE, or on our other subReddit: /r/AvoidSuicide

*Know someone in suicide prevention? Share:*
www.reddit.com/r/SuicidePreventionRes

---

Also, professionals and volunteers alike are encouraged to respond/relate on r/suicidewatch or r/SuicidalPeople (our new subReddit). *You could help save a life today!*
 
---

Like /r/suicidology ... **This subReddit is devoted to understanding and preventing suicide.** 

Suicidology is defined as the study of suicide and suicide prevention. However, because some people see suicidology as the objective study of suicide (whether pro or con), the /r/suicidology subReddit has had issues with pro-suicide postings, and has had to change their moderation polices to keep it more focused on suicide prevention.
 
Since this subReddit has the word 'prevention' in the title, the hope is that it can remain focused on research and info that helps **prevent suicide**, rather than discussions about the pros and cons or rightness/wrongness of committing suicide. 
 
While there may be nothing inherently 'wrong' about an individual choosing to end their life, and the creator/moderator(s) of this subReddit are not taking a position against an individual's right to die; because the personal issues involved are often very complex; and because it is believed that the majority of suicidal people would much prefer to improve their lives and continue living if that were possible; and because many people who were once extremely suicidal have gone on to live happy, healthy, productive lives; the goal of this subReddit is to do everything possible to encourage people to stay alive and to promote all methods of suicide prevention that may help suicidal people overcome their struggles, rebuild their lives, and ultimately find the peace, happiness and fulfillment that all of us as humans long for.

* Properly  [link flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/flair) your posts.


2 [**Limit the Verbal Abuse.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules#wiki_2._no_verbal_abuse_of_any_sort.)

 * Keep it civil. Its not hard. 

3 [**No posts related to other subreddits**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules#wiki_3._no_posts_related_to_other_subreddits.2C_forums.2C_or_websites.)

* Simple enough, right? This is not /r/drama

4 [**No low quality posts.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules#wiki_4._no_low_quality_posts.)

 * E.g. Memes / Jokes / comics or unrelated content etc.

5 [**No reposts.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/rules#wiki_5._no_reposts.)

* Please try to limit your reposts. We don't need 50 stories about the same event. It will lead to other current stories being buried. 

#Know Your Rights

* [What To Do If You're Stopped By Police](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police/)

* [Take Jury Duty! Understand Jury Nullification. Stanhope Explains.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1k4fYIUuAP8)

* It is 100% legal to openly record police in all 50 states as long as you do not physically interfere with the officer. (It's also probably wise to speak as little as possible, but DO make note of details - location, names, etc) 

* Police officers do not have a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" while preforming their public duties.

* If an officer says it's illegal to record him, that officer is lying to try and trick you into shutting off the camera so you won't have proof of them violating your rights.

* Use a livestreaming app to record your videos. If your phone is seized, the police cannot delete the video because the video was never on the phone to begin with.

* [List of Livestreaming apps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/wiki/Apps)

#Medical Questions

This is not the place to ask medical questions. Do not ask for a diagnosis or treatment for yourself or anyone else.

You can find mental healthcare providers on websites like [this one](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists), by calling your health insurance company, or by contacting a mental health clinic or hospital in your area.

Our wiki has more in-depth information on the diagnosis process. Including how to find a doctor, what to expect from the appointment, and how to prepare. [Click here to get started.](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergirls/wiki/steps)

##RULES

NOTE: While there may be nothing inherently 'wrong' about an individual choosing to end their life, and the creator/moderator(s) of this subreddit are not taking a position against an individual's right to die; because the personal issues involved are often very complex; and because it is believed that the majority of suicidal people would much prefer to improve their lives and continue living if that were possible; and because many people who were once extremely suicidal have gone on to live happy, healthy, productive lives; the goal of this subreddit is to do everything possible to encourage people to stay alive and to promote all methods of suicide prevention that may help suicidal people overcome their struggles, rebuild their lives, and ultimately find the peace, happiness and fulfillment that all of us as humans long for.

All are welcome to participate who agree to follow the rules outlined below:</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h1>Rules</h1>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<h3>1: Be respectful</h3>

<p>No GSRM-Phobic content (i.e: homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, aphobia, as well as racism, serophobia, ableism, or sexism) If you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please precede your post&#39;s title with [TW]. For example: &quot;[TW] Title of Post&quot;. Do not try to start an argument for the sake of an argument. Do not make personal attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<h3>2: Must have willingness to learn; no &#39;you&#39;re too sensitive&#39;</h3>

<p>Demonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a safe space. Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim a pejorative so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes about them, or that they otherwise just &quot;shouldn&#39;t be so sensitive.&quot; For lightly moderated LGBT-related discussion, we recommend <a href=""/r/ainbow"">/r/ainbow</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<h3>3: No bait-and-switch posts</h3>

<p>Bait and switch type threads, where the title makes them look like a bigot but the body is supportive, are not allowed on <a href=""/r/lgbt"">r/lgbt</a>. LGBTQ+ people see enough hate in our lives, without &#39;Gotcha&#39; bait posts.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<h3>4: No advertisements, spam, or crowdfunders</h3>

<p><a href=""/r/lgbt"">r/lgbt</a> is here for LGBTQ+ people, their lives, their stories, their content. It is not here for advertising or spam. This includes the advertising of crowdfunders, we cannot verify them, so for safety, we do not allow them.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<h3>5: No survey and research requests</h3>

<p>We are unable to accommodate Survey and Research requests, posts that fall into this category shall be removed. Repeat posters will be banned. We suggest you post these requests to <a href=""/r/lgbtstudies"">/r/lgbtstudies</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<h3>6: No promoting hate</h3>

<p>Having posted to subreddits with a negative reputation is not necessarily grounds for an automatic ban, but users whose posting history contains bigotry will be met with intense scrutiny.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<h3>7: Don&#39;t share hate speech</h3>

<p><a href=""/r/lgbt"">r/lgbt</a> is a safe space, and while we want everyone to be able to seek support and advice, sharing hate speech in any way can cause harm to the community.</p>

#### [](#h4-green)

>This subreddit is by and for people who are Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities (GSRM), including but by no means limited to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) people, and respect for our diversity and experiences is paramount. All are welcome to participate who agree to follow the rules outlined below:

-------------


# Rules

---

>###1: Be respectful   
No GSRM-Phobic content (i.e: homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, aphobia, as well as racism, serophobia, ableism, or sexism) If you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please precede your post's title with [TW]. For example: ""[TW] Title of Post"". Do not try to start an argument for the sake of an argument. Do not make personal attacks.

---

>###2: Must have willingness to learn; no 'you're too sensitive'   
Demonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a safe space. Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim a pejorative so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes about them, or that they otherwise just ""shouldn't be so sensitive."" For lightly moderated LGBT-related discussion, we recommend /r/ainbow. 

---

>###3: No bait-and-switch posts   
Bait and switch type threads, where the title makes them look like a bigot but the body is supportive, are not allowed on r/lgbt. LGBTQ+ people see enough hate in our lives, without 'Gotcha' bait posts.

---

>###4: No advertisements, spam, or crowdfunders   
r/lgbt is here for LGBTQ+ people, their lives, their stories, their content. It is not here for advertising or spam. This includes the advertising of crowdfunders, we cannot verify them, so for safety, we do not allow them.

---

>###5: No survey and research requests   
We are unable to accommodate Survey and Research requests, posts that fall into this category shall be removed. Repeat posters will be banned. We suggest you post these requests to /r/lgbtstudies.

---

>###6: No promoting hate   
Having posted to subreddits with a negative reputation is not necessarily grounds for an automatic ban, but users whose posting history contains bigotry will be met with intense scrutiny.

---

>###7: Don't share hate speech    
r/lgbt is a safe space, and while we want everyone to be able to seek support and advice, sharing hate speech in any way can cause harm to the community.

---

>###8: Don't direct message individual mods about a moderation issue--use modmail!   
Please send [a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flgbt) to r/lgbt rather than DMing individual moderators. This will allow the whole team to know what is going on so the correct moderator can deal with the issue.

---

>###9: NSFW Content.   
r/lgbt is meant to be safe for users of all ages. Do not submit content that a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in public or at the workplace. This includes pornography, sexualized content, graphic violence, or similar. Discussions of sexual topics, including sexual health, are permitted but must be tagged NSFW.

---

>###10: Provide sources when sharing news
We require any post sharing news/social media reactions to news articles to include a link to the original article or announcement in the post body.

---

>###11: No posts asking to rate, roast, or make assumptions about you or your identity.
These posts encourage stereotyping or making assumptions about people based on presentation. Often these can make people uncomfortable and bring out a mix of stereotypes and pressure to present a specific way. This rule includes, but is not limiting to; asking whether or not you pass, asking people to guess your gender/sexuality, and asking people to make assumptions about you based on your appearance.

---

>###12: Moderator Discretion.
Unfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover, in those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we think could potentially cause harm or does not fit within the spirit of the community and the safe space we maintain here, even if it do not fit one of the rules perfectly.

>###13: Use Content Warning flair for upsetting posts.
If you think community members might be upset by the content you are sharing, use the content warning flair, adding a short description. The post will be automatically marked as a spoiler, but please check our rules on NSFW content and sharing hate.

<ul>
<li>Posts may contain multiple images, either natively through Reddit&#39;s multi-image feature or hosted on Imgur. All images in an album post must <em>only</em> contain the roastee(s), and the first image <em>must</em> have a sign (e.g. old pictures of you the roastee as a young child are allowed so long as a current picture of them with a sign is present).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>All individuals in the picture must be holding the <a href=""/r/RoastMe"">r/RoastMe</a> sign or indicate they are aware of the sign in some way (e.g. by pointing to it). Photos with non-Roastees in the background will be removed if their faces are visible.</p></li>
<li><p>Photoshopped/edited posts are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed. This <strong>includes</strong> Snapchat filters such as the digitally-added flowers or dog ears. Posting multiple edited photos will result in a ban.</p></li>

<li><p>No joke roasts. Anyone posting a dog, or a ham, or Anne Frank, or Donald Trump, or anything like that will be banned for 3 days. It&#39;s not funny.</p></li>

<li><p>No ads. No onlyfans</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Roasters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is a comedy subreddit, not a hate subreddit. Act as though you are trying to make an audience laugh. Please familiarize yourself with all rules before participating.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is also not <a href=""/r/ToastMe"">/r/ToastMe</a>. You are here to roast, not flatter. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You <em>are</em> allowed to look through the roastee&#39;s post history. Do <strong><em>not</em></strong> roast a roastee anywhere outside of this subreddit. Any such outside harassment is not sanctioned by <a href=""/r/RoastMe"">/r/RoastMe</a>, and will result in a ban upon discovery.</p></li>
<li><p>Never post another user&#39;s personal information, referred to as &#39;doxxing&#39;. We will always report violations to the admins.</p></li>
<li><p>Never use suicide, homicide, assault, racism, or pedophilia as the crux of a roast. These subjects are never funny.</p></li>
<li><p>Please don&#39;t use link shorteners in comments (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>3 rule violations and you may face a ban</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you see something that breaks the rules, please report them or send us a modmail.</p>

All images in an album post must *only* contain the roastee(s), and the first image *must* have a sign (e.g. old pictures of you the roastee as a young child are allowed so long as a current picture of them with a sign is present).

 * All individuals in the picture must be holding the r/RoastMe sign or indicate they are aware of the sign in some way (e.g. by pointing to it). Photos with non-Roastees in the background will be removed if their faces are visible.

 * Photoshopped/edited posts are **NOT** allowed. This **includes** Snapchat filters such as the digitally-added flowers or dog ears. Posting multiple edited photos will result in a ban.

 * Your post will not appear until after it has been approved by a moderator. Please send [this message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/roastme&subject=Post Not Approved&message=Hello, I don't believe my post has been approved yet. Could you please approve my post? Add link to post here: (Make sure you link to the reddit post, not the imgur!\)) if it takes longer than 1 hour.

 * The minimum posting age is **18** years old, your post will be rejected if you look younger or if context clues lead us to conclude you are younger.

 * By submitting a Roast, you agree to your picture being saved, hosted on Imgur, and reposted to Reddit for the purpose of inclusion on ""Best Of"" and ""Highlights"" albums.

 * Your face must be at least 60% visible in the photo.

 * You may post on behalf of other people, provided that the post follows all of the other rules listed above, and it is clear that the person being posted consents to the roast.

 * No joke roasts. Anyone posting a dog, or a ham, or Anne Frank, or Donald Trump, or anything like that will be banned for 3 days. It's not funny.

 * No sexualized content. There are plenty of humiliation fetish subreddits for you, and we aren't one of them.


 * No ads. No onlyfans

**Roasters:**

 * This is a comedy subreddit, not a hate subreddit. Act as though you are trying to make an audience laugh. Please familiarize yourself with all rules before participating.

* This is also not /r/ToastMe. You are here to roast, not flatter. 

 * You *are* allowed to look through the roastee's post history. Do ***not*** roast a roastee anywhere outside of this subreddit. Any such outside harassment is not sanctioned by /r/RoastMe, and will result in a ban upon discovery.

 * Never post another user's personal information, referred to as 'doxxing'. We will always report violations to the admins.

 * Never use suicide, homicide, assault, racism, or pedophilia as the crux of a roast. These subjects are never funny.

 * Please don't use link shorteners in comments (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)

   **3 rule violations and you may face a ban**


If you see something that breaks the rules, please report them or send us a modmail.

**Highlights** is an inspiration album with the goal of inspiring comedic creativity in a set demographic. These are posted when a demographic has enough quality roasts to compile into an album. Roasters who make the list, are not awarded with flair.

[Highlights I: The Ladies of /r/RoastMe](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/3s1u32/introducing_highlights_best_ofs_with_a_theme/)

[Highlights II: Dark Meat](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/4j4lm7/highlights_ii_dark_meat/)

**Best Of** is meant to showcase the best roasts based on creativity, sting, and comedic value of no specific demographic. We post these monthly, and the roasters who make the list are awarded with flair.

<p>2.

<p>7.
Keep content relevant</p>

<h5>Welcome to <a href=""/r/Futurology"">r/Futurology</a></h5>

<p>A subreddit devoted to the field of Future(s) Studies and evidence-based speculation about the development of humanity, technology, and civilization.</p>

<h5>Posting Rules</h5>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.</li>
<li>Submissions must be <em>future focused</em>. All posts must have an initial comment, a <strong>Submission Statement</strong>, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future.</li>
<li>No memes, reaction gifs or similarly low effort content. Images/gifs require a starter comment.</li>
<li>No spamming - this includes polls and surveys. This also includes promoting any content in which you have any kind of financial or non-financial stake.</li>
<li>Bots require moderator permission to operate</li>
<li>Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length. Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence are a distraction to discussion of futurology and may be removed.</li>
<li>Account age: &gt;1 day to comment, &gt;5 days to submit content</li>
<li>Submissions and comments of accounts whose combined karma is too far in the negatives will be removed</li>
<li>Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.</li>
<li>Text posts need to encourage in-depth and detailed discussion. Avoid generalized invitations to discuss frequently discussed topics. Submissions with <strong>[in-depth]</strong> in the title have stricter post length and quality guidelines</li>
<li>Titles must accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission</li>
<li>Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content</li>
<li>Content older than 6 months must have [month, year] in the title</li>
</ol>

<h5>On Futurology</h5>

<p>If history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called &quot;future(s)&quot; by many of the field&#39;s practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). </p>

<p>One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur. </p>

#####Welcome to r/Futurology

A subreddit devoted to the field of Future(s) Studies and evidence-based speculation about the development of humanity, technology, and civilization.

#####Posting Rules

>
1. Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.
2. Submissions must be *future focused*. All posts must have an initial comment, a **Submission Statement**, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future.
3. No memes, reaction gifs or similarly low effort content. Images/gifs require a starter comment.
4. No spamming - this includes polls and surveys. This also includes promoting any content in which you have any kind of financial or non-financial stake.
5. Bots require moderator permission to operate
6. Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length. Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence are a distraction to discussion of futurology and may be removed.
7. Account age: >1 day to comment, >5 days to submit content
8. Submissions and comments of accounts whose combined karma is too far in the negatives will be removed
9. Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.
10. Text posts need to encourage in-depth and detailed discussion. Avoid generalized invitations to discuss frequently discussed topics. Submissions with **[in-depth]** in the title have stricter post length and quality guidelines
11. Titles must accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission
12. Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content
13. Content older than 6 months must have [month, year] in the title
>
For details on the rules see the
 [**Rules Wiki**](/r/futurology/wiki/rules).

#####On Futurology

If history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called ""future(s)"" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). 

One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.

Not everyone has the means to access a formal diagnosis for any number of reasons, especially due to medical professionals being difficult to access, prohibitively expensive, or holding extremely outdated beliefs.</p>

<p>Diagnoses change and they can vary between professionals. This is a peer space which values the lived-experience of ND people and their own identities.</p>

This is a support space. Comments which are rude, offensive, harsh, unnecessarily critical, impolite, or trolling will be removed.

**3) Posts must focus on Life Pro Tips (whether sharing advice, seeking it, or celebrating LPT victories)**

**4) Adhere to site-wide rules**

*""5) Self-diagnosis is valid**  
Not everyone has the means to access a formal diagnosis for any number of reasons, especially due to medical professionals being difficult to access, prohibitively expensive, or holding extremely outdated beliefs.

Diagnoses change and they can vary between professionals. This is a peer space which values the lived-experience of ND people and their own identities.

Do not invalidate the self-diagnosis of others.

Do not treat self-diagnosed people as lesser than formally diagnosed people.

**6) This subreddit is agnostic on the debate surrounding the term ""neurodivergent""**  
Unfortunately there is no accepted catch-all term which is widely accepted across the broader neurodiverse community.

This sub acknowledges that some people feel that the term ""neurodivergent"" is problematic and can be used for purposes of erasure.

There is a character limit for subreddits and ""ND""/""neurodivergent"" currently has the most utility. This is not a political position but a matter of necessity.

Debates on the term ND are better suited to other discussion-focused subs.",True,,,False,,True,en,,/r/NDLifeProTips/,1642729700.0,,,,False,False,r/NDLifeProTips/,

<h1>Voting Guide</h1>

<p>In your top level comment be sure to include one abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.</p>

<p><strong>YTA</strong> = You&#39;re the Asshole; </p>

<p><strong>YWBTA</strong> = You Would Be the Asshole;</p>

<p><strong>NTA</strong> = Not the A-hole; </p>

<p><strong>YWNBTA</strong> = You Would Not be the Asshole;</p>

<p><strong>ESH</strong> = Everyone Sucks here;</p>

<p><strong>NAH</strong> = No A-holes here; </p>

<p><strong>INFO</strong> = Not Enough Info </p>

<hr/>

<h1><strong>Rules</strong></h1>

<h2>1. Be Civil</h2>

<p>Attack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.</p>

<p>This rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don&#39;t insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don&#39;t lecture people about the rules (use reports).</p>

<p>Be respectful. Be nice. Don&#39;t be an asshole.</p>

<h2>2. Voting Rules</h2>

<p>Upvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. <strong>DON&#39;T</strong> downvote if you think OP is an asshole. <strong>DON&#39;T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH.</strong> Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. <strong>Brigading will earn a permanent ban.</strong></p>

<h2>3. Accept Your Judgment</h2>

<p>This sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.</p>

<h2>4. Never Delete An Active Discussion</h2>

<p>DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for <strong>at least 48 hours</strong>. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.</p>

<h2>5. No Violence</h2>

<p>Don&#39;t even <em>mention</em> violence.</p>

<p>If your post or comment references violence, don&#39;t share it here. Any hint, mention, euphemism or suggestion of violence falls under this rule and isn&#39;t allowed.</p>

<p>Comments and even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, &quot;bad karma,&quot; property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited. <strong>Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.</strong></p>

<h2>6. How To Post</h2>

<p>The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.</p>

<p>Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don&#39;t link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can&#39;t explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else&#39;s account or a shared account.</p>

<h2>7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts</h2>

<p>Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be &quot;the asshole.&quot;</p>

<p>Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.</p>

<h2>8. No Shitposts</h2>

<p>Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written by you, from your point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.</p>

<p>This is not a humor sub. This isn&#39;t a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, or creative writing exercises.</p>

<p>Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.</p>

<h2>9. Do Not Ask For Advice</h2>

<p>This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.</p>

<p>You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.</p>

<p>If a thread&#39;s focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP&#39;s intent.</p>

<h2>10. Updates and META posts are restricted</h2>

<p>Posts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed &amp; may result in a ban.</p>

<p>Update posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/zn2kbnnw"">update criteria</a> for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.</p>

<p>This is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.</p>

<h2>11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts</h2>

<p>We do not allow posts where the central conflict is about familial or platonic partings, relationships, and/or reproductive autonomy.</p>

<p>The following posts are forever banned:</p>

<p>AITA for breaking up with/ghosting/cutting contact with _ (or not)</p>

<p>AITA for dating _ (or not)</p>

<p>AITA for doing sexual act _ (or not)</p>

<p>AITA for being attracted to _ (or not)</p>

<p>Any reproductive autonomy decision</p>

<p>Any posts related to cheating- including &quot;telling on&quot; someone for cheating (or not).</p>

<p>And similar.</p>

<h2>12. This Is Not A Debate Sub</h2>

<p>If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you&#39;re ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.</p>

<p>No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups</p>

<h2>13. No Revenge Stories</h2>

<p>There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you&#39;re here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you&#39;re probably breaking this rule.</p>

<h2>14. No Medical Conflicts</h2>

<p>AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit&#39;s paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.</p>

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in a real-world argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.

This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.

After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq).

<p>From Wikipedia, &quot;<em>Neurodiversity refers to variations in the human brain regarding sociability, learning, attention, mood, and other mental functions</em>&quot;. It is essentially a rebranding of the term &quot;mentally ill&quot; or &quot;mentally dysfunctional&quot; to eliminate the stigma of these disorders and to view them not as defects but as variations in human behavior and sense of self. This includes, but is not limited to, Aspergers/ASD, ADHD, BPD, OCD, etc.</p>

<p><strong>What is Marxism?</strong> </p>

<p>From Wikipedia, &quot;<em>Marxism is a theory and method of working-class self-emancipation. As a theory, it relies on a method of socioeconomic analysis that views class relations and social conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and takes a dialectical view of social transformation</em>&quot;. Marxism is a growing/changing economic/sociopolitical worldview and method of socioeconomic inquiry based upon a materialist interpretation of historical development, a dialectical view of social change, and an analysis of class-relations within society and their application in the analysis and critique of the development of capitalism.

<p><strong>How does Marxism and Neurodiversity Relate?</strong></p>

<p>Neurodiverse individuals are often treated as barriers to economic growth and progress by capitalists for their behaviors interrupting the flow of workplace productivity. Neurodiverse individuals cannot function the same as their neurotypical peers, and therefor cannot perform the same labor or with the same efficiency as the bourgeoisie would want. Capitalists attempt to remedy these &quot;dysfunctions&quot; through the application of medication or treatment to &quot;normalize&quot; these individuals and make them more fit for the capitalist workforce. Neurodiverse Marxists view this as a violation of ND folk&#39;s autonomy and freedom of expression, and is only an attempt to erase the existence of these groups to no longer hinder capitalist growth and exploitation. Within a Marxist society, ND individuals would not have to alter themselves for workplace efficiency, and would have the time and means of probing their true interests and hobbies without an income to feel fulfilled or happy.</p>

<p><em>&quot;For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic&quot;</em> - Karl Marx</p>

From Wikipedia, ""*Neurodiversity refers to variations in the human brain regarding sociability, learning, attention, mood, and other mental functions*"". It is essentially a rebranding of the term ""mentally ill"" or ""mentally dysfunctional"" to eliminate the stigma of these disorders and to view them not as defects but as variations in human behavior and sense of self. This includes, but is not limited to, Aspergers/ASD, ADHD, BPD, OCD, etc.

**What is Marxism?** 

From Wikipedia, ""*Marxism is a theory and method of working-class self-emancipation. As a theory, it relies on a method of socioeconomic analysis that views class relations and social conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and takes a dialectical view of social transformation*"". Marxism is a growing/changing economic/sociopolitical worldview and method of socioeconomic inquiry based upon a materialist interpretation of historical development, a dialectical view of social change, and an analysis of class-relations within society and their application in the analysis and critique of the development of capitalism. Marxism encompasses an economic theory, a sociological theory, a philosophical method and a revolutionary view of social change.

8. **No posts that harm the community:** Do not post pictures of tagging/vandalism, encourage driving while high (including pictures where you are obviously driving while high), post about sneaking weed past TSA, or make other posts harmful to the trees community.
9. **No posts promoting political candidates:** Posts that endorse a political candidate, regardless of the connection to cannabis, are disallowed.  
10. **No posts involving a personal loss:** Those should be kept to the ""Monday Mourning"" thread each week.

* Every **Saturday**, *we relax our rules*. Artwork, GIFs, and image macros are all permitted for the day.
* Not everything goes though: you still **can't** upload NSFW, ask for hookups/meetups, show disrespect towards other users or advertise anything *at all*. Read more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2hhh5t/introducing_slack_post_saturday_bringing_back/).

####SELF-POST SUNDAY
 ---
* Every **Sunday**, *you can submit text posts only.*
* This allows for a break from all of the link posts during the week, so the community can share their stories and talk with each other. Naturally, we are less strict regarding the removal of text posts.

<h4>AM I FACE BLIND?</h4>

<p>Facial recognition is a spectrum. If you&#39;re asking yourself this question, you likely do have some degree of face blindness.</p>

<p>Some common signs include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Having trouble recognizing family and friends</p></li>
<li><p>Frequently using non-facial cues to recognize people (voice, hairstyles, distinctive features) and experiencing difficulty if those cues change (getting a haircut, wearing unfamiliar clothing)</p></li>
<li><p>Confusing characters while watching movies/TV</p></li>
<li><p>Not recognizing people &quot;out of context&quot; (coworkers, classmates, etc.)</p></li>

<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Be nice. </li>
<li><strong>Provide Info:</strong> When you ask for advice, give as much information as possible (e.g., LSAT/GPA/URM, age, where you want to practice, ties to the area, what kind of law you want to do, total cost of attendance). When posting an admissions decision, please provide as much information as you are comfortable communicating. We <strong>will not</strong> remove a post for not including stats, as we respect people&#39;s privacy decisions and encourage everyone to participate. However, please consider the benefit that slightly anonymized stats would provide to the community.</li>
<li><strong>On giving advice:</strong> When giving advice, answer the question first. If both options asked about are bad, you can point that out too and explain why.</li>
<li><strong>Affirmative action discussion policy:</strong> <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/aludrb/re_affirmative_action_stats_and_admission/"">See this post</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Advice here often seems harsh. Here&#39;s why: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/310alw/on_blunt_advice/"">on blunt advice</a></p>

<p>For book length coverage of the dire state of America&#39;s law school market, this is required reading: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Law-School-Unless-Opportunity/dp/1480163686/"">Don&#39;t go to law school unless</a></p>

<p><strong>New Community Members</strong></p>

<p>Welcome! We hope you are able to benefit from and contribute to our community of law school applicants. In order to cut down on spam and trolling, new members to <a href=""/r/lawschooladmissions"">r/lawschooladmissions</a> and Reddit may have their posts automatically filtered for manual review based on a variety of account factors. If you believe your post was filtered and is still not approved after 24 hours, feel free to send a message to the mods. Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Retakes</strong></p>

<p>Retakes are a no brainer in these circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>You scored at the low end of your PT average</li>
<li>Your scores were still increasing in the weeks up to test day</li>
<li>You had less than perfect on logic games</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of these are true for you, and you&#39;re clearly stalled, then make this clear. Most people posting have retake potential.</p>

<p>Even 2-3 points can make a large difference in admissions/scholarships. That&#39;s why so many people here post &quot;retake!&quot; to a lot of situations.</p>

<p><strong>Canada?</strong> Most people here are US. So most advice doesn&#39;t apply. Feel free to ask questions, though, there are some Canadians. Big differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Almost no scholarships. </li>
<li>Most schools are pretty good.</li>
<li>Go where you want to practice</li>
<li>GPA is significantly more important. Do all you can to raise it.</li>
<li>For god&#39;s sake don&#39;t go abroad. That&#39;s Canada&#39;s TTT.</li>

**Rules**

* Be nice. 
* **Provide Info:** When you ask for advice, give as much information as possible (e.g., LSAT/GPA/URM, age, where you want to practice, ties to the area, what kind of law you want to do, total cost of attendance). When posting an admissions decision, please provide as much information as you are comfortable communicating. We **will not** remove a post for not including stats, as we respect people's privacy decisions and encourage everyone to participate. However, please consider the benefit that slightly anonymized stats would provide to the community.
* **On giving advice:** When giving advice, answer the question first. If both options asked about are bad, you can point that out too and explain why.
* **Affirmative action discussion policy:** [See this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/aludrb/re_affirmative_action_stats_and_admission/).

**New Community Members**

Welcome! We hope you are able to benefit from and contribute to our community of law school applicants. In order to cut down on spam and trolling, new members to r/lawschooladmissions and Reddit may have their posts automatically filtered for manual review based on a variety of account factors. If you believe your post was filtered and is still not approved after 24 hours, feel free to send a message to the mods. Thank you!

**Retakes**

Retakes are a no brainer in these circumstances:

* You scored at the low end of your PT average
* Your scores were still increasing in the weeks up to test day
* You had less than perfect on logic games

If none of these are true for you, and you're clearly stalled, then make this clear. Most people posting have retake potential.

Even 2-3 points can make a large difference in admissions/scholarships. That's why so many people here post ""retake!"" to a lot of situations.

**Canada?** Most people here are US. So most advice doesn't apply. Feel free to ask questions, though, there are some Canadians. Big differences:

* Almost no scholarships. 
* Most schools are pretty good.
* Go where you want to practice
* GPA is significantly more important. Do all you can to raise it.
* For god's sake don't go abroad. That's Canada's TTT.",True,,,False,,True,en,all_ads,/r/lawschooladmissions/,1375382246.0,"[1280, 384]",,,False,False,r/lawschooladmissions/,

sting someone, you die.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t waste it on a squirrel.

<li>Not enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.</p>

<ul>
<li>What does that do?</li>
<li>Oatches that little strand of honey</li>
</ul>

<p>that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.</p>

<p>Oan anyone work on the Krelman?</p>

<p>Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know</p>

<p>that every small job,
if it&#39;s done well, means a lot.</p>

<p>But choose carefully</p>

<p>because you&#39;ll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>The same job the rest of your life?
I didn&#39;t know that.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the difference?</p>

<p>You&#39;ll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven&#39;t had one day off</p>

<p>in 27 million years.</p>

<p>So you&#39;ll just work us to death?</p>

<p>We&#39;ll sure try.</p>

<p>Wow! That blew my mind!</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s the difference?&quot;
How can you say that?</p>

<p>One job forever?
That&#39;s an insane choice to have to make.</p>

<p>I&#39;m relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.</p>

<p>But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?</p>

<p>Why would you question anything?
We&#39;re bees.</p>

<p>We&#39;re the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.</p>

<p>You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?</p>

<p>Like what? Give me one example.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. But you know
what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.</p>

<p>Wait a second. Oheck it out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!</li>
<li>Wow.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen them this close.</p>

<p>They know what it&#39;s like
outside the hive.</p>

<p>Yeah, but some don&#39;t come back.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hey, Jocks!</li>
<li>Hi, Jocks!</li>
</ul>

<p>You guys did great!</p>

<p>You&#39;re monsters!
You&#39;re sky freaks! I love it! I love it!</p>

<ul>
<li>I wonder where they were.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t know.</li>
</ul>

<p>Their day&#39;s not planned.</p>

<p>Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.</p>

<p>You can&#39;tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Look. That&#39;s more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps. Unless you&#39;re wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.</p>

<p>Those ladies?
Aren&#39;t they our cousins too?</p>

<p>Distant. Distant.</p>

<p>Look at these two.</p>

<li>Oouple of Hive Harrys.</li>
<li>Let&#39;s have fun with them.</li>

<p>It must be dangerous

<p>Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!</p>

<p>He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh, my!</li>
<li>I never thought I&#39;d knock him out.</li>
</ul>

<p>What were you doing during this?</p>

<p>Trying to alert the authorities.</p>

<p>Yeah. Gusty.</p>

</ul>

</ul>

<p>We&#39;re going 0900 at J-Gate.</p>

<p>What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?</p>

<p>I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.</p>

<p>Hey, Honex!</p>

<p>Dad, you surprised me.</p>

<p>You decide what you&#39;re interested in?</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, there&#39;s a lot of choices.</li>
<li>But you only get one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?</p>

<p>Son, let me tell you about stirring.</p>

<p>You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.</p>

<p>You get yourself into a rhythm.
It&#39;s a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,</p>

<p>maybe the honey field
just isn&#39;t right for me.</p>

<p>You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.</p>

<p>Janet, your son&#39;s not sure
he wants to go into honey!</p>

<ul>
<li>Barry, you are so funny sometimes.</li>
<li>I&#39;m not trying to be funny.</li>
</ul>

<p>You&#39;re not funny! You&#39;re going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#39;re gonna be a stirrer?</li>
<li>No one&#39;s listening to me!</li>
</ul>

<p>Wait till you see the sticks I have.</p>

<p>I could say anything right now.
I&#39;m gonna get an ant tattoo!</p>

of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.

Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen

It's just a status symbol.

- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just

You get yourself into a rhythm.

Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

for an article? Search [Libgen](https://www.libgen.is/scimag/index.php) for its DOI, PMID or
title, or [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.do/) for its DOI, PMID or URL. Looking for
a book? Search [Libgen](https://www.libgen.is/) or [Z-Library](https://z-lib.org/) for
its ISBN or title. More info on Libgen and Sci-Hub can be found
[here](https://redd.it/3bs1rm).

[WorldCat](http://www.worldcat.org/) record.

<em>The quick and dirty version (or click <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines"">here</a> for the full set):</em> </p>

<h2><strong>Minimum participation requirements:</strong></h2>

<p>✓ Participants here must participate in good faith.<br/>
✓ Verify your account through Reddit&#39;s email verification system.<br/>
✓ Meet a minimum karma requirement.     </p>

<h2><strong>About what you post:</strong></h2>

<p>✓ Use the search tool <a href=""/r/AskWomen/w/index"">and FAQ</a> before you post.<br/>
✖ No personal advice or posts about your personal situation.<br/>
✖ No seeking medical advice or information.<br/>
✖ No pot-stirring or discussion of other subreddits.<br/>
✖ No agenda questions. This is not your personal soapbox.<br/>
✖ No &quot;would you rather&quot; or &quot;does anyone else&quot; posts permitted.<br/>
✖ No yes/no questions.<br/>
✖ No gifts or shopping posts about specific brands or stores.<br/>
✖ No surveys or research.</p>

<h2><strong>About how you post it:</strong></h2>

<p>✓ Post titles must be a descriptive, in depth question and searchable using keywords, or will be removed. DAE or questions that can be answered with just a yes/no will be removed<br/>
✓ Please use &quot;spoiler&quot; formatting where appropriate.  Follow [text you wish to hide] with (/spoiler), (#spoiler), or (/s) to activate. <a href=""#spoiler"">SPOILER</a><br/>
✖ No personal attacks.<br/>
✖ <a href=""/r/askwomen/w/genderedslurs"">No gendered slurs.</a><br/>
✖ No graceless generalizations. Speak only for yourself. Do not generalize based on gender, race, or ethnicity.<br/>
✖ No misogyny, misandry, transphobia, ageism, racism, general assholery, invalidation, or otherwise hateful or disrespectful commentary.<br/>
✖ No derailing. Talk via PM or start a new thread.<br/>
✖ No specifying majority demographics or excluding minority groups based on demographics.<br/>
✖ No questions about genital size, shape, or configuration preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>About links:</strong></h2>

<p>✓ Links MUST be accompanied by a summary.<br/>
✖ No posting personal pictures.<br/>
✖ No linking to other subreddits.<br/>
✖ No linking to specific threads in <a href=""/r/askwomen"">/r/askwomen</a> in other subreddits.<br/>
✖ No self-promotion.<br/>
✖ No using URL-shortening sites.  </p>

<h2><a href=""#icon-exclamation""></a><strong>Violating any of these rules will result in moderator action.</strong></h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/wiki/rules#wiki_recommendations.3A""></a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>✓ Please be inclusive with question phrasing. Questions specifying majority demographics are not permitted.<br/>
✖ Downvote only to indicate that either a comment or post does not add to discussion; not to indicate disagreement. AskWomen benefits from honest answers with a variety of perspectives. On that note, saying, &quot;Be honest,&quot; is rude and unnecessary.<br/>
✓ Familiarize yourself with <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/2by6wm/reddit_101/"">Reddit 101.</a><br/>
✓ Use the report button on all comments and posts that violate the rules in the sidebar.<br/>
✓ Add flair!  We have flair for men, women, trans folks, and gender neutral people.<br/>
✓ Be specific: ask a general question, get a general answer.<br/>
✓ This is not a debate sub. Attempts to invalidate or argue someone else&#39;s response are not permitted.<br/>
✓ Common topics are determined by how often the topics come up, how likely the answers are to change, and whether it is already a FAQ topic. The timeframe for considering something common or recently asked takes all of that into account.</p>

<p>⚠ <strong>Moderator Discretion:</strong> While the rules of this sub are listed above, no set of rules can cover all of the content that people may post. Unfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover. In those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we find insidious, inflammatory, or that does not fit within the spirit of the community even if the stated rules do not specifically disallow that content.  In short, don&#39;t be an asshole </p>

*The quick and dirty version (or click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines) for the full set):* 

>##**Minimum participation requirements:**
✓ Participants here must participate in good faith.     
✓ Verify your account through Reddit's email verification system.     
✓ Meet a minimum karma requirement.     


>##**About what you post:**
✓ Use the search tool [and FAQ](/r/AskWomen/w/index) before you post.  
✖ No personal advice or posts about your personal situation.  
✖ No seeking medical advice or information.  
✖ No pot-stirring or discussion of other subreddits.  
✖ No agenda questions. This is not your personal soapbox.  
✖ No ""would you rather"" or ""does anyone else"" posts permitted.  
✖ No yes/no questions.    
✖ No gifts or shopping posts about specific brands or stores.  
✖ No surveys or research.


>##**About how you post it:**
✓ Post titles must be a descriptive, in depth question and searchable using keywords, or will be removed. DAE or questions that can be answered with just a yes/no will be removed    
✓ Please use ""spoiler"" formatting where appropriate.  Follow [text you wish to hide] with (/spoiler), (#spoiler), or (/s) to activate. [SPOILER](#spoiler)    
✖ No personal attacks.  
✖ [No gendered slurs.](/r/askwomen/w/genderedslurs)  
✖ No graceless generalizations. Speak only for yourself. Do not generalize based on gender, race, or ethnicity.    
✖ No misogyny, misandry, transphobia, ageism, racism, general assholery, invalidation, or otherwise hateful or disrespectful commentary.  
✖ No derailing. Talk via PM or start a new thread.    
✖ No specifying majority demographics or excluding minority groups based on demographics.     
✖ No questions about genital size, shape, or configuration preferences.



>##**About links:**
✓ Links MUST be accompanied by a summary.    
✖ No posting personal pictures.    
✖ No linking to other subreddits.  
✖ No linking to specific threads in /r/askwomen in other subreddits.  
✖ No self-promotion.    
✖ No using URL-shortening sites.  

>##[](#icon-exclamation)**Violating any of these rules will result in moderator action.**

##### [](#h5-yellow)
>[](http://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/wiki/rules#wiki_recommendations.3A) 

✓ Please be inclusive with question phrasing. Questions specifying majority demographics are not permitted.    
✖ Downvote only to indicate that either a comment or post does not add to discussion; not to indicate disagreement. AskWomen benefits from honest answers with a variety of perspectives. On that note, saying, ""Be honest,"" is rude and unnecessary.     
✓ Familiarize yourself with [Reddit 101.]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/2by6wm/reddit_101/)    
✓ Use the report button on all comments and posts that violate the rules in the sidebar.     
✓ Add flair!  We have flair for men, women, trans folks, and gender neutral people.     
✓ Be specific: ask a general question, get a general answer.   
✓ This is not a debate sub. Attempts to invalidate or argue someone else's response are not permitted.   
✓ Common topics are determined by how often the topics come up, how likely the answers are to change, and whether it is already a FAQ topic. The timeframe for considering something common or recently asked takes all of that into account.


⚠ **Moderator Discretion:** While the rules of this sub are listed above, no set of rules can cover all of the content that people may post. Unfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover. In those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we find insidious, inflammatory, or that does not fit within the spirit of the community even if the stated rules do not specifically disallow that content.  In short, don't be an asshole

It&#39;s a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,</p>

<p>maybe the honey field
just isn&#39;t right for me.</p>

<p>You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a bad job

of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.

outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

- I don't know.

<p><strong>Peer counselling practice – how do peers provide counselling?</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The role of the peer is to provide support.  They have learned to listen without judgement and assist the client to explore their concerns and find their own solutions.   The peer is non-judgemental, and carefully listens to the client.  With the peer’s empathic understanding the client is able to explore fully their concerns and arrive at their own solutions.   The peers initially may wish to “help” and often find it difficult not to offer advice, but they also have learned that by “fixing”, they limit exploration of the problem and the client is less likely to act on the offered solution.   By not “fixing” and offering advice the peers are free to focus on the client’s feelings, emotions and concerns.  Through this process, the client feels heard, accepted, and safe to explore fully the issue at hand.</p>

<p>It is important for agencies that provide services to a community ensure that there will not be harm done by the peers providing counselling.  The NANNIE process as outlined in this manual strives to reduce harm, this is done by not offering advice or “fixes” for problems.&quot;</p>

<p>Counsellors are to use the NANNIE approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No Judgement</p></li>
<li><p>Acceptance</p></li>
<li><p>No Fixing/No advice</p></li>
<li><p>No Questions</p></li>
<li><p>It is not about you</p></li>
<li><p>Empathy</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Peer counsellors must also display the following attributes of non-directive counselling, as outlined by <a href=""http://bcoleman.ca/manual-for-peer-counsellor-training/"">Bill Coleman PhD in his manual for peer counsellors</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Focus on the experiencing of self</li>
<li>Moment by moment empathy</li>
<li>High level of personal presence</li>
<li>Egalitarian stance</li>
<li>Self-determination and free choice as human possibilities</li>
<li>Pro-social nature of human beings</li>
<li>The client is the expert</li>
<li>The peer accepts the clients knowledge</li>
<li>The client is the expert for both the content and process of discussion</li>
<li>The peer is a facilitator for the client</li>
<li>The peer is wholly present</li>
<li>The client comes first (client centred)</li>
<li>Counselling is the art of “not knowing” not fixing not having answers….</li>
<li> The non-directive approach sees resources instead of problems</li>

<p>8.) Abelism in any form is not welcome. Any posts or comments suggest that autistic people are less than human or don&#39;t have opinions that mater will result in the ban hammer slamming down with a minimum 6-month ban. Since this is not 4-chan, we expect you to respect autistic people. Since this is not middle or high school, we expect you not to bully autistic people. If what you&#39;re going to post is not going to make autistic people in this subreddit feel safe and welcome don&#39;t post it.</p>

<p>9.) No buying or selling of drugs in this forum. While I personally think that the Drug War should end and people should be allowed to buy or sell whatever they want Reddit doesn&#39;t want their service to turn into a black market for drugs. Plus, if you can&#39;t figure out how to access the darknet and buy some cryptocurrency without handholding from people on Reddit, psychedelics might not be right for you at this point in your life.</p>

<p>10.) Instructions on how to extract psychedelics from plants are OK  in this subreddit as long as the actual sales of plants are not being conducted. Please warn people about the dangers of extraction methods. I would rather people talk about extractions and learn how to extract chemicals safely than risk their health because of a lack of information how to perform a safe extraction.</p>

<p>11.) Any questions about harm-reduction such as but not limited to the proper dose to use, or where to buy test kits or other harm reduction tools are OK in this subreddit. Message the mods before linking anything for sale so we can tell you if it is OK to post or not if you want to avoid a ban for selling drugs in this subreddit. </p>

<p>12.) We are tolerant of the autistic and are not ban happy. If you make a mistake and promise not to do the same thing twice, we&#39;ll unban you. If you do the same thing a 2nd time, you&#39;ll get banned again. We want to make this place autistic-friendly and understand that some autistic people may not understand the rules; we don&#39;t want to unjustly ban an autistic person over a mistake, but we also want to make this subreddit a safe place for all. </p>

If what you're going to post is not going to make autistic people in this subreddit feel safe and welcome don't post it.

9.) No buying or selling of drugs in this forum. While I personally think that the Drug War should end and people should be allowed to buy or sell whatever they want Reddit doesn't want their service to turn into a black market for drugs. Plus, if you can't figure out how to access the darknet and buy some cryptocurrency without handholding from people on Reddit, psychedelics might not be right for you at this point in your life.

10.) Instructions on how to extract psychedelics from plants are OK  in this subreddit as long as the actual sales of plants are not being conducted. Please warn people about the dangers of extraction methods. I would rather people talk about extractions and learn how to extract chemicals safely than risk their health because of a lack of information how to perform a safe extraction.

11.) Any questions about harm-reduction such as but not limited to the proper dose to use, or where to buy test kits or other harm reduction tools are OK in this subreddit. Message the mods before linking anything for sale so we can tell you if it is OK to post or not if you want to avoid a ban for selling drugs in this subreddit. 

12.) We are tolerant of the autistic and are not ban happy. If you make a mistake and promise not to do the same thing twice, we'll unban you. If you do the same thing a 2nd time, you'll get banned again. We want to make this place autistic-friendly and understand that some autistic people may not understand the rules; we don't want to unjustly ban an autistic person over a mistake, but we also want to make this subreddit a safe place for all. 

If you have any doubts about whether or not a post is OK to make in this subreddit message the mods making the post.

#Rules:

##Must reference anime.

All posts must contain some reference to an anime, to anime in general, to a virtual YouTuber, to an anime community, or to a game with anime style art.

This sub is intended for people with Asperger's, but it is not necessary for all posts to be *about* Asperger's.

Posts that are specifically about Asperger's will however get a bit more leeway with this rule.

*(i.e. If a post references a Japanese non-anime game, or a show that is often mistaken for anime, it will be fine so long as it an aspie meme.)*

If a meme references one of the required topics for this rule, but is also about Asperger's, then it may be eligible for the [hall of fame](https://old.reddit.com/r/AspieAnimemes/wiki/hall_of_fame).

##Be polite.

Rude words aren't allowed here.

This is an Asperger's sub; talking negatively about people with Asperger's with the intention to offend is forbidden, and could result in a ban.

People who think that Asperger's is completely negative, or something that should be ""cured"" are not welcome here.

##Anime music only.

If a video post contains sound, then any music in it must be from an anime.

##NSFW posts and spoilers must be marked as such.

If a post has content that isn't safe for under 18s, then please mark it with the NSFW tag. If your post might make people browsing in public uncomfortable, but doesn't contain any adult content, then use the spoiler tag and write ""NSFS"" (Not safe for school) in the title, enclosed by square brackets.

If your post is a spoiler; use the spoiler tag and write ""Spoiler"" in the title, enclosed by square brackets. If your post isn't NSFS, but is a spoiler, then please mark it as such, but there is no real need to write ""spoiler"" in the title as well.

All posts should contain the name of anime that they reference (Source ^(()^(also known as the Sauce)^) ) in the title. They should also show what episode the meme references/is about, especially if it is a spoiler.

##Use titles sensibly.

Titles must describe the post, or add information. They shouldn't be part of the meme, or irrelevant to the post.

Posts should contain the name of anime that they reference (Source, or sauce) in the title. This is so that people who are interested can easily find out about it, and so that people can see what anime it spoils if it is a spoiler.

Titles shouldn't contain spoilers, as they can be seen without going in to the post.

<p><strong>The Light Therapy Reddit</strong></p>

<p><strong>Light Therapy</strong> - classically referred to as heliotherapy—consists of exposure to daylight or to specific wavelengths of light using polychromatic polarised light, lasers, light-emitting diodes, fluorescent lamps, dichroic lamps or very bright, full-spectrum light. The light is administered for a prescribed amount of time and, in some cases, at a specific time of day.</p>

<p>One common use of the term is associated with the treatment of skin disorders, chiefly psoriasis, acne vulgaris, eczema and neonatal jaundice.</p>

<p>Light therapy which strikes the retina of the eyes is used to treat diabetic retinopathy and also circadian rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder and can also be used to treat seasonal affective disorder, with some support for its use also with non-seasonal psychiatric disorders.</p>

**The Light Therapy Reddit**

**Light Therapy** - classically referred to as heliotherapy—consists of exposure to daylight or to specific wavelengths of light using polychromatic polarised light, lasers, light-emitting diodes, fluorescent lamps, dichroic lamps or very bright, full-spectrum light. The light is administered for a prescribed amount of time and, in some cases, at a specific time of day.

One common use of the term is associated with the treatment of skin disorders, chiefly psoriasis, acne vulgaris, eczema and neonatal jaundice.

Light therapy which strikes the retina of the eyes is used to treat diabetic retinopathy and also circadian rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder and can also be used to treat seasonal affective disorder, with some support for its use also with non-seasonal psychiatric disorders.

Selective Mutism (SM), sometimes called Situational Mutism, is a complex situational anxiety disorder characterized by a person's inability to speak and communicate in certain social settings such as school. These people may be able to communicate in other settings where they are relaxed and secure, such as at home (although the opposite can and does occur).

Outside of speech, all forms of communication may be inhibited to varying levels by situation. That includes written language, body language, gestures, and facial expression.

have worked your whole life</p>

<p>Oan anyone work on the Krelman?</p>

<p>Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know</p>

<p>that every small job,
if it&#39;s done well, means a lot.</p>

<p>But choose carefully</p>

<p>The same job the rest of your life?
I didn&#39;t know that.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven&#39;t had one day off</p>

<p>So you&#39;ll just work us to death?</p>

A subreddit for the great Space X masterrace to discuss the words of EloN and his Glorious company Space X

&nbsp;

Bunch of rules:

1. Posts should at least tangentially relate to Space X / Ol' Musky / Unknown people named Jeff; Political posts must be related to spaceflight
2. Reuse is good, but don't reuse (repost) other people's OC
3. This is a meme subreddit; let's keep it lighthearted and in good faith.
4. Don't harass anybody
5. If you're posting artist content from other sites, please share the links directly instead of reposting the images
6. Stay norminal

Your post needs to inspire discussion, ask an open-ended question that prompts redditors to share ideas or opinions.**

**Questions need to be neutral and the question alone.** Any opinion or answer must go as a reply to your question, this includes examples or any kind of story about you. This is so that all responses will be to your question, and there's nothing else to respond to. Opinionated posts are forbidden.

* If your question has a factual answer, try r/answers.
* If you are trying to find out about something or get an explanation, try r/explainlikeimfive
* If your question has a limited number of responses, then it's not suitable.
* If you're asking for any kind of advice, then it's not suitable.
* If you feel the need to add an example in order for your question to make sense then you need to re-word your question.
* If you're explaining why you're asking the question, you need to stop.

<h2><strong><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/faq"">FAQ</a></strong></h2>

<h2><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki"">Our Wiki</a></h2>

<h2><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/hub"">Related subreddits</a></h2>

<p>Here&#39;s a general synopsis and explanation of <a href=""/r/writing"">/r/writing</a>&#39;s community rules. Please keep these guidelines in mind for all of your posts and comments. The moderators do reserve the right to remove posts/comments that are deemed harmful without warning and ban users depending on the severity of the infraction.</p>

<hr/>

<h2><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/rules"">Posting Guidelines</a></h2>

<h3>1. Posting Work</h3>

<p>Samples of writing, whether for critique, self-promotion, or general sharing, may only be posted in the weekly self-promotion and critique thread. Requests for writing partners may also only be posted in the critique thread. Requests for school help should be posted in <a href=""/r/homeworkhelp"">r/homeworkhelp</a>, including posts about school essays or citations.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>2. Self-Promotion</h3>

<p>We do not allow advertisements for your book, website, new subreddit, etc., or for you to do so on behalf of another company, outside of the self-promotion thread. This includes both posts and comments.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>3. Posts should be thoughtful and useful to a broad community of writers</h3>

<p>We ask that users frame their posts so they are useful to multiple people. If your post invites answers that are specific to your work alone, it belongs in our brainstorming thread. “Low effort” posts (two lines of text, repetitive questions, etc.) will be removed. Posts focused on personal sharing may only be posted in the general discussion thread.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>4. Submission Calls Requirements/AMAs</h3>

<p>Calls for submissions (including posts about general writing work) must include 1) payment information; 2) submission deadlines; 3) rights requested; 4) any other relevant information. Directing to a website to answer these questions is not allowed. Please limit yourself to one post per publishing cycle. AMAs may not be posted without mod approval. We prefer subjects be part of the wider writing industry or have done something more than publish a book. Please message modmail for AMA requests.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>5. Civility</h3>

<p>Treat other people with decency and respect. We encourage healthy debate and discussion, but we will remove antagonistic, caustic, or otherwise belligerent posts. We moderate on tone rather than language.
Racist, homophobic/transphobic, misogynistic, ableist, and other categories of hate speech (including against “acceptable targets”) will be removed. Please report any instances of offensive talk, and the mods will deal with them. Internet vigilantism and doxxing will not be tolerated.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>6. Call-out threads and genre/literary-bashing</h3>

<p>The forum is a place where we all come together to celebrate what we do: write. We will remove posts: berating other people for their genre/subject/literary taste; adherence or non-adherence to rules; calling people morons for giving a particular sort of advice; insisting that their opinion is the only one worth having; being antagonistic towards particular types of books or audiences; or implying that a particular work is for “idiots”, or “snobs”, etc.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Help keep the subreddit clean and on-topic by using the report feature to bring attention to rule-breaking posts. If your post has been removed and you do not know why or you have any other questions about these guidelines, please contact the moderators.</p>

#Before posting, check out:

## **[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/faq)**
##[Our Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki)
##[Related subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/hub)



Here's a general synopsis and explanation of /r/writing's community rules. Please keep these guidelines in mind for all of your posts and comments. The moderators do reserve the right to remove posts/comments that are deemed harmful without warning and ban users depending on the severity of the infraction.

---



##[Posting Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/rules)

###1. Posting Work
Samples of writing, whether for critique, self-promotion, or general sharing, may only be posted in the weekly self-promotion and critique thread. Requests for writing partners may also only be posted in the critique thread. Requests for school help should be posted in r/homeworkhelp, including posts about school essays or citations.

---

###2. Self-Promotion
We do not allow advertisements for your book, website, new subreddit, etc., or for you to do so on behalf of another company, outside of the self-promotion thread. This includes both posts and comments.

---

###3. Posts should be thoughtful and useful to a broad community of writers
We ask that users frame their posts so they are useful to multiple people. If your post invites answers that are specific to your work alone, it belongs in our brainstorming thread. “Low effort” posts (two lines of text, repetitive questions, etc.) will be removed. Posts focused on personal sharing may only be posted in the general discussion thread.

---

###4. Submission Calls Requirements/AMAs
Calls for submissions (including posts about general writing work) must include 1) payment information; 2) submission deadlines; 3) rights requested; 4) any other relevant information. Directing to a website to answer these questions is not allowed. Please limit yourself to one post per publishing cycle. AMAs may not be posted without mod approval. We prefer subjects be part of the wider writing industry or have done something more than publish a book. Please message modmail for AMA requests.

---

###5. Civility
Treat other people with decency and respect. We encourage healthy debate and discussion, but we will remove antagonistic, caustic, or otherwise belligerent posts. We moderate on tone rather than language.
Racist, homophobic/transphobic, misogynistic, ableist, and other categories of hate speech (including against “acceptable targets”) will be removed. Please report any instances of offensive talk, and the mods will deal with them. Internet vigilantism and doxxing will not be tolerated.

---

###6. Call-out threads and genre/literary-bashing
The forum is a place where we all come together to celebrate what we do: write. We will remove posts: berating other people for their genre/subject/literary taste; adherence or non-adherence to rules; calling people morons for giving a particular sort of advice; insisting that their opinion is the only one worth having; being antagonistic towards particular types of books or audiences; or implying that a particular work is for “idiots”, or “snobs”, etc.

<h2>General Rules</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Absolutely no bigotry of any kind.</strong> This includes transphobia (including non-binary erasure; see rule 2), homophobia, sexism, ableism, racism, xenophobia, acephobia, truscummery or any other form of marginalization or discrimination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bigotry towards non-binary people is transphobia.</strong> Being trans-positive entails being supportive of non-binary people; no exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No spam.</strong> This includes both advertising and breaking Reddit&#39;s site-wide rules, such as vote manipulation or brigading.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Posts must also be topically relevant to trans people or trans issues.</strong>  Political opinions are okay, but users must be respectful of the views of others.  Political posts unrelated to trans topics are subject to removal. <em>If you want to make political shitposts, please see the list of political trans subs below.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Selfies are not memes!</strong> Selfies are not memes! This is not a subreddit for selfies. Selfies can be posted in <a href=""/r/transtimelines"">r/transtimelines</a>, <a href=""/r/MTFSelfieTrain"">r/MTFSelfieTrain</a>, <a href=""/r/FTM_SELFIES"">r/FTM_SELFIES</a>, <a href=""/r/nonbinary"">r/nonbinary</a>, and many other places. As for bandwagons such as picrews, lilystory, or other character makers, or anything else bandwagon-y, please direct them to <a href=""/r/traandwagon"">r/traandwagon</a>! For more info, check out the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/comments/cmk9q7/announcements_decisions_on_bandwagons_plus_the/"">announcement post</a> about the rule change!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t be a dick; have fun!</strong> This is no place for quarrels! Users who fail to be civil will be issued a warning and/or ban. User post history, comment history, and active subreddits will be considered in conjunction with violations of the rules. There will be only one warning. <em>We do not care if you are right. We care about your attitude.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>This is not a NSFW sub.</strong> This is an all ages sub, so take the NSFW stuff to one of the adult oriented subs. Check out the sidebar to find subs that may be more fitting for that stuff.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Submission Rules</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Submissions MUST BE A MEME or they will be removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Submissions must be an image (.jpg, .png, .gif, .gifv, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Image submissions should only link to trusted image sharing sites, e.g. imgur.com, livememe.com, reddituploads.com, giphy.com, and gfycat.com.</p></li>
<li><p>You are encouraged to post web comics and art from their original artists page rather than rehosting the image some where else. However, Automoderator will remove them, so please <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftraaaaaaannnnnnnnnns"">message us</a> when you do, so we can override it.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;d like to post reddit threads or messages, take a screen shot and edit out other users&#39; names. This protects privacy and removes the chance for a brigade. [because np.reddit is a joke] </p></li>
<li><p>Please do not link to any terf, racist, or any other hate subreddits. Bigots like those do not deserve any attention. Any post or comment linking to a hate subreddit will be removed. Please see the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/wiki/postguide#wiki_transphobic_postings"">post guide wiki</a> section on transphobic content for more info on this front.</p></li>

## General Rules

1. **Absolutely no bigotry of any kind.** This includes transphobia (including non-binary erasure; see rule 2), homophobia, sexism, ableism, racism, xenophobia, acephobia, truscummery or any other form of marginalization or discrimination.

2. **Bigotry towards non-binary people is transphobia.** Being trans-positive entails being supportive of non-binary people; no exceptions.

3. **No spam.** This includes both advertising and breaking Reddit's site-wide rules, such as vote manipulation or brigading.

4. **Posts must also be topically relevant to trans people or trans issues.**  Political opinions are okay, but users must be respectful of the views of others.  Political posts unrelated to trans topics are subject to removal. *If you want to make political shitposts, please see the list of political trans subs below.*

5. **Selfies are not memes!** Selfies are not memes! This is not a subreddit for selfies. Selfies can be posted in r/transtimelines, r/MTFSelfieTrain, r/FTM_SELFIES, r/nonbinary, and many other places. As for bandwagons such as picrews, lilystory, or other character makers, or anything else bandwagon-y, please direct them to r/traandwagon! For more info, check out the [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/comments/cmk9q7/announcements_decisions_on_bandwagons_plus_the/) about the rule change!

6. **Don't be a dick; have fun!** This is no place for quarrels! Users who fail to be civil will be issued a warning and/or ban. User post history, comment history, and active subreddits will be considered in conjunction with violations of the rules. There will be only one warning. *We do not care if you are right. We care about your attitude.*

7. **This is not a NSFW sub.** This is an all ages sub, so take the NSFW stuff to one of the adult oriented subs. Check out the sidebar to find subs that may be more fitting for that stuff.




## Submission Rules

1. Submissions MUST BE A MEME or they will be removed.

2. Submissions must be an image (.jpg, .png, .gif, .gifv, etc)

3. Image submissions should only link to trusted image sharing sites, e.g. imgur.com, livememe.com, reddituploads.com, giphy.com, and gfycat.com.

4. You are encouraged to post web comics and art from their original artists page rather than rehosting the image some where else. However, Automoderator will remove them, so please [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftraaaaaaannnnnnnnnns) when you do, so we can override it.

5. If you'd like to post reddit threads or messages, take a screen shot and edit out other users' names. This protects privacy and removes the chance for a brigade. [because np.reddit is a joke] 

6. Please do not link to any terf, racist, or any other hate subreddits. Bigots like those do not deserve any attention. Any post or comment linking to a hate subreddit will be removed. Please see the [post guide wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/wiki/postguide#wiki_transphobic_postings) section on transphobic content for more info on this front.

<p>consider posting to <a href=""/r/selfimprovement"">/r/selfimprovement</a> or <a href=""/r/DecidingToBeBetter"">/r/DecidingToBeBetter</a>  as  <strong>you will NOT be allowed to post or comment in this subreddit.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<h6><strong>BEFORE YOU POST OR COMMENT, READ THE RULES:</strong></h6>

<blockquote>
<p><a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/rules"">Click here</a> for more detailed information on the rules of this sub, our trigger warnings and our tagging practices.</p>

<p><strong>When you comment, assume a <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/assume_a_context_of_abuse"">context of abuse</a> to all posts.</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Be nice.</strong> No personal attacks, name-calling, or bigotry. Exercise empathy. Respect boundaries. No <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/slurs"">slurs</a> or <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/victimblaming"">victim-blaming</a>.  <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/downvotes"">Don&#39;t downvote.  Speak with your upvotes</a>. No fatphobia, transphobia, etc.</p>

<p><strong>No posts about politicians or political parties.</strong></p>

<p><strong>No diagnosis by media/drive-by diagnosis.</strong> Do not post about celebrities, people in the media, random strangers or anyone else that you don&#39;t personally know. This subreddit is for posts about abusers that you know personally, and that are abusing you personally.</p>

<p><strong>Advising anyone in this group to commit suicide or referring them to groups that give this sort of advice will result in an immediate ban.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Respect each other and follow Reddiquette.</strong> Mods may remove posts and comments that are hurtful or not in the spirit of the subreddit at their discretion. Help us preserve a respectful, supportive atmosphere. Your tone matters when responding to others (especially when the post has a &quot;Suppport&quot; flair), so please be kind! </p>

<p><strong>Do not <a href=""http://bit.ly/1M2zdvP"">derail</a> the posts of others.</strong></p>

<p><strong>No generalizing about groups of people.</strong> This includes race, religion, profession, gender, political party, age, ethnicity, etc.</p>

<p><strong>No advocating abusive practices.</strong> This includes current controversial ideas in discipline, medicine, or science that are abusive or misinformative. We stick to the verifiable truth as best we can on RBN, and to advocating healthy practices. This also includes anything relating to theft, slander, lawbreaking, as well as all forms of corporal punishment (i.e.: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/spanking"">no pro-spanking posts or comments</a>), anti-vaccination and other pseudoscience. </p>

<p><strong>No encouragement of illegal drug use or self-medication</strong> without medical supervision, and no advising against proper medical treatment.</p>

<p><strong>No asking or offering of gifts, money, donations, etc.</strong> No GoFundMe, crowdsourcing or fundraising sites.</p>

<p><strong>No links or recommendations to hate groups.</strong></p>

<p><strong>No posts or comments advocating violence, murder or revenge (even in jest).</strong></p>

<p><strong>No posts about N-kids.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Narcissists are NOT allowed to post or comment here.</strong></p>

<p><strong>No <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/rules#wiki_No_platitudes_or_generic_motivational_posts"">platitudes or generic advice or motivational posts</a></strong> Solicited in advice in comments to posters is fine.  Making generic advice posts, such as this title example, is not allowed: Three tips to shut a Narcissist down! No posts like &quot;ACoNs are an inspiration to me&quot; or or &quot;I feel so bad for all of you and I really love my normal parents&quot; or &quot;IF I CAN DO IT, YOU CAN TOO!&quot; or &quot;You make me a better parent because your posts about the trauma you experienced shows me how to not mess up my kids&quot;. Instead, please support our posters directly by commenting directly on their posts.  Let&#39;s keep the people who NEED support in the spotlight and give them direct support!</p>

<p><strong>No graphic or clickbait titles.</strong>  <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7gav2n/read_me_new_guidelines_for_titles_and_trigger/"">Examples here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Please flair triggering content such as graphic physical abuse, sexual abuse or animal abuse.</strong>  The flair button will appear under your post after the post has been submitted.  </p>

<p><strong>Maintain anonymity and privacy</strong> <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/chatgroups"">No linking to personal or public Facebook pages, Discords, chat rooms/groups, or identifying information.</a> Do not ask OPs for more identifying information if it is not provided. Posts that contain an abundance of personally identifying information may be removed to safeguard the community and the poster.</p>

<p><strong>You may link an entire sub (for example, <a href=""/r/BPDlovedones"">/r/BPDlovedones</a> or <a href=""/r/suicidewatch"">/r/suicidewatch</a>), but not directly linking to a post/comment.  When you link to a post or comment, please use a np.reddit.com link.  Posts or comments that encourage brigading will be removed.</strong>(<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/linkingexceptions"">Further explanation here.</a>).</p>

<p><strong>No pure image posts</strong> - Memes, etc., must be contained within a self-post. (<a href=""http://redd.it/220out"">Example.</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Moderation in this group is always biased FOR the OP (the person who made the post - not the commenters).</strong>  For example, if an OP does not appreciate comments of a religious nature, the moderators will defend the OP&#39;s boundaries.  If an OP prefers comments of a religious nature, the moderators will also defend that boundary. This is a support group - we are all here to support the OP. We often see commenters confused and feel that any comment should be allowed. But, we are biased FOR the OP&#39;s needs and boundaries.  When you write your own post asking for support, we will also be biased for you.</p>

<p><strong>Please keep in mind that the mods here are unpaid volunteers with their own busy lives and jobs and struggles.</strong>  We are not online 24/7.  We cannot read every post or comment.  We are not omnipotent.  We aren&#39;t aware of every problem, so <strong>please use the report button to flag the mods for problematic posts/comments you see in this group.</strong></p>

<p><strong>While you&#39;re at it, <a href=""https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette"">check out Reddiquette</a>.</strong>  Not all the guidelines are appropriate for this group, but most are.  It&#39;s a good baseline for behavior on Reddit.com in general!</p>

<p><strong>Disagree with a Mod decision?  Modmail us!</strong>  Modmail reaches the entire Mod team, we will review and respond as soon as we reasonably can.  Rules lawyering will not help your cause.</p>

#####What is a narcissist?  
>Trait lists are [**here**](http://bit.ly/UGimaE) and tactics that narcissists use can be found [**here**](http://tcat.tc/29lJchB).  While they are titled traits specific to mothers, fathers can have these same traits.


#####If you fear you may be a narcissist, check out this post: [HELP!  I think I am a narcissist!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/tpl9q4/help_i_think_i_am_a_narcissist/?)


#####If you **know** you are a narcissist, if you identify as a narcissist, sociopath or psychopath or have a diagnosis of NPD or ASPD, 
consider posting to /r/selfimprovement or /r/DecidingToBeBetter  as  **you will NOT be allowed to post or comment in this subreddit.**

---

######**BEFORE YOU POST OR COMMENT, READ THE RULES:**

>[Click here](/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/rules) for more detailed information on the rules of this sub, our trigger warnings and our tagging practices.

>**When you comment, assume a [context of abuse](/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/assume_a_context_of_abuse) to all posts.**  

>**Be nice.** No personal attacks, name-calling, or bigotry. Exercise empathy. Respect boundaries. No [slurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/slurs) or [victim-blaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/victimblaming).  [Don't downvote.  Speak with your upvotes](/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/downvotes). No fatphobia, transphobia, etc.

>**No posts about politicians or political parties.**

>**No diagnosis by media/drive-by diagnosis.** Do not post about celebrities, people in the media, random strangers or anyone else that you don't personally know. This subreddit is for posts about abusers that you know personally, and that are abusing you personally.

>**Advising anyone in this group to commit suicide or referring them to groups that give this sort of advice will result in an immediate ban.**

>**Respect each other and follow Reddiquette.** Mods may remove posts and comments that are hurtful or not in the spirit of the subreddit at their discretion. Help us preserve a respectful, supportive atmosphere. Your tone matters when responding to others (especially when the post has a ""Suppport"" flair), so please be kind! 

>**Do not [derail](http://bit.ly/1M2zdvP) the posts of others.**

>**No generalizing about groups of people.** This includes race, religion, profession, gender, political party, age, ethnicity, etc.

>**No advocating abusive practices.** This includes current controversial ideas in discipline, medicine, or science that are abusive or misinformative. We stick to the verifiable truth as best we can on RBN, and to advocating healthy practices. This also includes anything relating to theft, slander, lawbreaking, as well as all forms of corporal punishment (i.e.: [no pro-spanking posts or comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/spanking)), anti-vaccination and other pseudoscience. 

>**No encouragement of illegal drug use or self-medication** without medical supervision, and no advising against proper medical treatment.

>**No asking or offering of gifts, money, donations, etc.** No GoFundMe, crowdsourcing or fundraising sites.

>**No links or recommendations to hate groups.**

>**No posts or comments advocating violence, murder or revenge (even in jest).**

>**No posts about N-kids.** 

>**Narcissists are NOT allowed to post or comment here.**

>**No [platitudes or generic advice or motivational posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/rules#wiki_No_platitudes_or_generic_motivational_posts)** Solicited in advice in comments to posters is fine.  Making generic advice posts, such as this title example, is not allowed: Three tips to shut a Narcissist down! No posts like ""ACoNs are an inspiration to me"" or or ""I feel so bad for all of you and I really love my normal parents"" or ""IF I CAN DO IT, YOU CAN TOO!"" or ""You make me a better parent because your posts about the trauma you experienced shows me how to not mess up my kids"". Instead, please support our posters directly by commenting directly on their posts.  Let's keep the people who NEED support in the spotlight and give them direct support!

>**No graphic or clickbait titles.**  [Examples here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7gav2n/read_me_new_guidelines_for_titles_and_trigger/)

>**Please flair triggering content such as graphic physical abuse, sexual abuse or animal abuse.**  The flair button will appear under your post after the post has been submitted.  

>**Maintain anonymity and privacy** [No linking to personal or public Facebook pages, Discords, chat rooms/groups, or identifying information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/chatgroups) Do not ask OPs for more identifying information if it is not provided. Posts that contain an abundance of personally identifying information may be removed to safeguard the community and the poster.

>**You may link an entire sub (for example, /r/BPDlovedones or /r/suicidewatch), but not directly linking to a post/comment.  When you link to a post or comment, please use a np.reddit.com link.  Posts or comments that encourage brigading will be removed.**([Further explanation here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/linkingexceptions)).

>**No pure image posts** - Memes, etc., must be contained within a self-post. ([Example.](http://redd.it/220out)).

>**Moderation in this group is always biased FOR the OP (the person who made the post - not the commenters).**  For example, if an OP does not appreciate comments of a religious nature, the moderators will defend the OP's boundaries.  If an OP prefers comments of a religious nature, the moderators will also defend that boundary. This is a support group - we are all here to support the OP. We often see commenters confused and feel that any comment should be allowed. But, we are biased FOR the OP's needs and boundaries.  When you write your own post asking for support, we will also be biased for you.

>**Please keep in mind that the mods here are unpaid volunteers with their own busy lives and jobs and struggles.**  We are not online 24/7.  We cannot read every post or comment.  We are not omnipotent.  We aren't aware of every problem, so **please use the report button to flag the mods for problematic posts/comments you see in this group.**

>**While you're at it, [check out Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette).**  Not all the guidelines are appropriate for this group, but most are.  It's a good baseline for behavior on Reddit.com in general!

>**Disagree with a Mod decision?  Modmail us!**  Modmail reaches the entire Mod team, we will review and respond as soon as we reasonably can.  Rules lawyering will not help your cause.

</blockquote>

<p>-- <strong>Manly P. Hall, <em>Secret Teachings of All Ages</em> (1928).</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The very word &quot;secrecy&quot; is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- <strong>John F. Kennedy, 1961.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- <strong>Corinthians 13:11-12, NKJV.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- <strong>Edward Bernays, <em>Propaganda</em> (1928).</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world? It is that we have only known the back of the world. We see everything from behind, and it looks brutal. That is not a tree, but the back of a tree. That is not a cloud, but the back of a cloud. Cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face? If we could only get round in front-- </p>

>The very word ""secrecy"" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.

-- **John F. Kennedy, 1961.** 

> When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.

-- **Corinthians 13:11-12, NKJV.** 

>The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. 

-- **Edward Bernays, *Propaganda* (1928).** 

> Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world? It is that we have only known the back of the world. We see everything from behind, and it looks brutal. That is not a tree, but the back of a tree. That is not a cloud, but the back of a cloud. Cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face? If we could only get round in front-- 

-- **Gilbert K. Chesterton, *The Man Who Was Thursday* (1908).**

[Mneumonese](http://redd.it/36g207) /noi̯məniz/ (etymologically mnemonically derived from ""**mnemon**ic"", ""von **Neumann**"", and ""-**ese**"") is an [a priori](http://tinyurl.com/lpy8l9h), [oligosynthetic](http://tinyurl.com/o62arwy), [philosophical](http://tinyurl.com/owywm9e), [logical](http://tinyurl.com/9ddwn), [psychological](http://tinyurl.com/6jkyqo), [self-referential](http://tinyurl.com/3pl4ay), [recursively defined](http://tinyurl.com/nvyqy7b), [programmatic](http://tinyurl.com/s46df) constructed language that is constructed completely out of [mnemonics](http://tinyurl.com/bjxf8).

So far, four phono-morphologies have been worked on which satisfy the above description, though only Mneumonese 2 and Mneumonese 3 have reached anywhere near completion. It is expected that Mneumonese 4 will be the final version of the language.

'**a**' --- a is a new concept definition, defined by its context.

[sense](http://tinyurl.com/psw2pf7) [set](http://tinyurl.com/ygy5ja6) -- the set of [meanings](http://tinyurl.com/o32l4sk) that a word can have in all of the [contexts](http://tinyurl.com/3msxud) that it can be used in

[b] -- A [gloss](http://tinyurl.com/jwmd88w) from a word **a** in language **A** into a language **B** is a brief translation of **a** into a word or short phrase in **B**, for the purpose of reading literal translations of **A** into **B**. On this subreddit, **A** is Mneumonese by default, and {**B** is the language of the text containing [b]} by default.

**The Light Therapies Reddit**

**Light Therapy** - classically referred to as heliotherapy—consists of exposure to daylight or to specific wavelengths of light using polychromatic polarised light, lasers, light-emitting diodes, fluorescent lamps, dichroic lamps or very bright, full-spectrum light. The light is administered for a prescribed amount of time and, in some cases, at a specific time of day.

One common use of the term is associated with the treatment of skin disorders, chiefly psoriasis, acne vulgaris, eczema and neonatal jaundice.

Light therapy which strikes the retina of the eyes is used to treat diabetic retinopathy and also circadian rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder and can also be used to treat seasonal affective disorder, with some support for its use also with non-seasonal psychiatric disorders.

# Rules:

Full rules and submission guidelines: https://old.reddit.com/r/HumanMicrobiome/about/rules/

1. If you are new to this sub please take some time to review the info in the sidebar & wiki before contributing. This area of research is growing rapidly. If you do not follow the research closely, please refrain from making authoritative statements. 
2. Do not use downvotes for disagreement. Use your words or the report function. We are here to learn and discuss, not to reinforce our preconceived notions. See: https://old.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette
3. Please use the stickied thread to give feedback/suggestions about the sub & its rules. Meta discussion elsewhere will be removed. 
4. This is a science/evidence based sub. Usage of scientific citations to support your claims is highly encouraged and may become mandatory. [Citing your degree/education is almost never appropriate](https://archive.ph/ATJZp#selection-2381.11-2385.1). 
5. Re ""go ask a doctor"". There are times where this is appropriate, and times where it is not. In general, we are here to share evidence-based information, so ""go ask someone else"" isn't a useful contribution. Especially since [most medical providers are not knowledgeable on the majority of information shared in this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/healthdiscussion/comments/8ghdv8/doctors_are_not_systematically_updated_on_the/).
6. Be civil & constructive. Engage in good faith. Trolls/agitators will be banned. Address the arguments, not the person. The subject of your sentence should be ""the evidence"" or ""this source"" or some other noun directly related to the topic of conversation. ""You"" statements are suspect.
7. Memes as top level submissions are not appropriate, but can be posted in the comments. Other low-scientific-quality content may be removed as well. You need to have a good reason for submitting old studies. 

Excessive rule breaking may result in a ban.

#Ban Appeal Information
To get a ban overturned you will have to submit an appeal. The appeal should display:

-Understanding of why you were banned,

-Remorse for the action(s) and/or...

-Convincing evidence or statement proving that you will not break subreddit rules in the future.

The appeal can be submitted in list or paragraph format (through modmail); but please understand that after the appeal is submitted, there is not a guaranteed removal of the ban. It means that subreddit moderators will discuss in detail whether or not it is appropriate to unban the person in question.

Please allow the moderators a few days after the submission of your appeal to get back to you.",True,,,False,,True,en,some_ads,/r/truscum/,1472454702.0,,,,False,False,r/truscum/,

<h2><strong>Not A Confession</strong></h2>

<p><strong>All submissions <em>must</em> be a confession!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>A confession is an admission of an illegal or immoral action you have intentionally committed that others are not aware of. It cannot be a thought, dream, opinion, kink, etc. Innocent mistakes or accidents are not intentionally committed. You cannot confess the misdeeds of other people. You MUST express regret for your actions in your post. </p></li>
<li><p>Your confession <strong>must</strong> be an act you committed.</p></li>
<li><p>If your submission does not contain a confession it will be removed.</p></li>
<li><p>An unpopular opinion is not a confession. </p>

<ul>
<li>Regardless of whatever unpopular opinion you hold, it doesn&#39;t classify here as a confession. You haven&#39;t done anything wrong, so to speak, so it isn&#39;t technically a confession. Better subreddits for this would be <a href=""/r/offmychest"">/r/offmychest</a>, <a href=""/r/TrueOffMyChest"">/r/TrueOffMyChest</a>, <a href=""/r/rant"">/r/rant</a>, or in some cases, <a href=""/r/relationships"">/r/relationships</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Your sexual exploration is not a confession; it&#39;s a part of finding out who you are. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""/r/confession"">/r/confession</a> is not a place for submissions that read like pornography. Despite our confessional theme, we don&#39;t find consensual sexual exploits sinful. <a href=""/r/gonewildstories"">/r/gonewildstories</a> would be a better place to share.
&nbsp;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Be Specific</strong></h2>

<p><strong>All confessions must be titled specifically!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your title must relay a brief idea of what wrongdoing you have committed. Submissions with vague titles will be removed.</p>

<p>We receive a lot of meta-confessions that lump a lot of confessions into one, and a lot of submissions with titles that hardly relate to the confessions within. These kinds of posts don&#39;t take the subreddit in the direction we want it to go—it dilutes the content and leads to far more submissions that read like creative writing rather than the thoughts of real people.</p>

<p>Ideally, your title is a TL;DR of your post.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Do Not Encourage Bad Behavior</strong></h2>

<p><em>Helping one another also means that we do not encourage bad behavior.</em></p>

<p>We will not accept posts that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>2a) encourage rape/rape culture; </p></li>
<li><p>2b) sexualise minors;</p></li>
<li><p>2c) are racist; or</p></li>
<li><p>2d) otherwise promote abusive or hateful behavior.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>No Relationship Related Posts</strong></h2>

<p><strong><a href=""/r/confession"">/r/confession</a> is not the place to seek relationship advice.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Even if your submission contains a confession, relationship-based confessions will be removed. <a href=""/r/relationships"">/r/relationships</a>, <a href=""/r/offmychest"">/r/offmychest</a>, or <a href=""/r/self"">/r/self</a> would be better places to share. We reserve the right to remove any posts referencing relationships, not just those seeking relationship advice.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>No Pedophilia Type Posts</strong></h2>

<p><strong>At this time, this subreddit does not accept pedophile-type confessions, even if the user is seeking help and/or working on their situation.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the past these types of confessions have been a fine line between acceptable and sexualizing minors. We recommend you seek out sources such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.virped.org/"">http://www.virped.org/</a> (18+ Only);</li>
<li>A counselor that can effectively aid you; or</li>
<li>Another subreddit like <a href=""/r/self"">/r/self</a>, or <a href=""/r/offmychest"">/r/offmychest</a>. However, we do not know their stance or moderation policy on pedophile-type posts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, We are not well versed in the help that may be available. Hopefully this is a starting point for you.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Limited Context</strong></h2>

<p><strong>We do not accept posts with limited context.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Confessing only the barest of snippets or most cryptic of details isn&#39;t the purpose of this sub. Understanding what you&#39;re confessing shouldn&#39;t be like pulling teeth, context is important.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>No Politics</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Political-themed posts are not allowed.</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>There are plenty of subs around Reddit to discuss your political views. </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Meta Posts</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Meta posts are for moderator use only.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are unable to discuss without being disrespectful, walk away.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>If you&#39;re posting on <a href=""/r/confession"">/r/confession</a>, chances are you&#39;re not in the best frame of mind to be fielding attacks on your credibility by the vast and uncaring anonymous internet.

<li><p>You may report spammy posts, but commenting solely to try to discredit the experience an OP has claimed to have is at best nonconstructive and at worst genuinely hurtful. Please message the moderators so they may decide if it should be taken down instead. </p></li>
<li><p>This extends to any harassment of OP.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>No Trolling</strong></h2>

<p><strong>No memes, trolling, or otherwise blatantly low-effort content.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There are many subreddits for us to fool around. This is a place for us to stay on topic. Comments and replies should be of substance and contribute to the conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Do Not Doxx</strong></h2>

<p><strong>No attempts to identify OP.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Not only is it against sitewide rules, but attempts to identify posters undermines the comfort and reassurance that lies in anonymity. </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Removal Appeal Process</strong></h2>

6. **No top-level text posts of quick questions that Wikipedia or Google could answer.** Our stickied [Beginner Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/mia85f/beginner_megathread_3_ask_your_questions_here/) is the appropriate forum for short form discussion.

7. **No top-level text posts about school or career path questions.** Our [School and Career Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/juu28q/school_career_megathread/) is the appropriate forum for discussion about these topics. (We’ll be stickying this megathread after a week or so once the rule changes are no longer new and we have a sticky slot available.)

8. **No undisclosed self-promotion.** Message the moderator team to request pre-approval for anything that promotes yourself, your employer, or something you made or contributed to.

<p><strong>HOW TO POST</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Only submit horrible <strong>comments</strong> that have been <strong>upvoted</strong> above a net score of <strong>+20</strong>. If a thread has multiple shitty comments, feel free to <a href=""http://redd.it/ohdqz"">compile them in an effortpost.</a></p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> Focus on the <strong>large, mainstream subreddits.</strong> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/wiki/lowhangingfruit"">Low-hanging fruit</a> from obvious <a href=""http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2012/spring/misogyny-the-sites"">hate groups</a>, circlejerks, troll subreddits, and the like can be submitted to the low-hanging fruit megathread located at the top of the sub.</p>

<p>Subreddits for kids are also off limits. They&#39;re still young, so they get a chance to grow out of their edginess.</p>

<p><strong>7. Titles</strong> should be <strong>direct quotes of comments</strong> (NO EDITORIALIZING) followed by <strong>the number of total votes</strong> in brackets like this: [+30]. (Effortpost titles can be anything.)</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> Submissions must be the <strong>direct permalink to the comment</strong>. If the comment you&#39;re linking to requires some <strong>context</strong>, just add <code>?context=x</code> to the URL, where <code>x</code> is the number of parent comments you want displayed.</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong> Don&#39;t link to threads you&#39;re involved in, or to shit you just disagree with</p>

<p><strong>10.</strong> Don&#39;t submit <strong>[META]</strong> posts without contacting the mods first. </p>

<p>No posting questions or &quot;discussions&quot; about feminism, social justice, etc. These belong in one of the appropriate Fempire discussion subs, such as <a href=""/r/SocialJustice101"">/r/SocialJustice101</a> or <a href=""/r/SRSDiscussion"">/r/SRSDiscussion</a>.</p>

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don&#39;t care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let&#39;s shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Can you believe this is happening? - I can&#39;t. I&#39;ll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I&#39;m excited. Here&#39;s the graduate. We&#39;re very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B&#39;s. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That&#39;s me! - Wave to us! We&#39;ll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I&#39;d make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I&#39;m glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I&#39;m not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don&#39;t waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it&#39;s just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it&#39;ll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She&#39;s my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we&#39;re all cousins. - Right. You&#39;re right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it&#39;s done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you&#39;ll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn&#39;t know that. What&#39;s the difference? You&#39;ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven&#39;t had one day off in 27 million years. So you&#39;ll just work us to death? We&#39;ll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! &quot;What&#39;s the difference?&quot; How can you say that? One job forever? That&#39;s an insane choice to have to make. I&#39;m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We&#39;re bees. We&#39;re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don&#39;t know. But you know what I&#39;m talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I&#39;ve never seen them this close. They know what it&#39;s like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don&#39;t come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You&#39;re monsters! You&#39;re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don&#39;t know. Their day&#39;s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can&#39;t just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That&#39;s more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It&#39;s just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you&#39;re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren&#39;t they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Couple of Hive Harrys. - Let&#39;s have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I&#39;d knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn&#39;t it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We&#39;re hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you&#39;re not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We&#39;re going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you&#39;re interested in? - Well, there&#39;s a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It&#39;s a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn&#39;t right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That&#39;s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son&#39;s not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I&#39;m not trying to be funny. You&#39;re not funny! You&#39;re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You&#39;re gonna be a stirrer? - No one&#39;s listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I&#39;m gonna get an ant tattoo! Let&#39;s open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I&#39;ll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody &quot;dawg&quot;! I&#39;m so proud. - We&#39;re starting work today! - Today&#39;s the day. Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them&#39;s yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. - What&#39;d you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Couple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What&#39;s available? Restroom attendant&#39;s open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you&#39;re on. I&#39;m sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey&#39;s always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He&#39;s dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That&#39;s life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we&#39;ve got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I&#39;m going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You&#39;re gonna die! You&#39;re crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone&#39;s feeling brave, there&#39;s a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn&#39;t that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck&#39;s restricted. It&#39;s OK, Lou. We&#39;re gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy&#39;s in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That&#39;s awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let&#39;s move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I&#39;m out! I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It&#39;s got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It&#39;s a little bit of magic. That&#39;s amazing. Why do we do that? That&#39;s pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Cool. I&#39;m picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don&#39;t we need those? Copy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You&#39;re reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Chemical-y. Careful, guys. It&#39;s a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Candy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama&#39;s little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Coming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don&#39;t think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point!</p>

Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Couple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Cool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don't we need those? Copy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Chemical-y. Careful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Candy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Coming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?!

- Disagreement is fine as long as you can disagree without resorting to invalidating someone else’s experiences or personal 
attacks.

#2: As mutual respect is important for the sub
- no biphobia, homophobia, transphobia, racism, misogyny, acephobia, ableism or other bigoted language will be allowed.

#3: Personal attacks will not be allowed
- Please keep personal disagreements with other members of the sub, personal. This sub is not an avenue to air personal grievances.

#4: No porn is allowed on the sub
- Adult-related content is fine (discussions about sex, for example), but please no videos (from xTube or similar sites) or nude/explicit pictures. This includes posts asking for people to sex chat with.

#5: Selfies may only be posted in Saturday's megathread. Pet photos may only be posted to Monday's megathread. Couple's photos may only be posted in Wednesday's megathread. 
- These posts will be removed if made outside of their designated megathreads. You can post your SFW pictures in /r/dykesgonemild or /r/lesbros during the week. [See the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/wiki/index) for more info.

#6: Post that don’t fit in the purpose of the sub will be removed
- Discussion towards cis and trans lesbians, bisexual girls, chicks who like chicks, bi-curious folks, dykes, butches, femmes, girls who kiss girls, birls, bois, aces, or anyone in the LGBT+ community.
- (being a place for queer women)

#7: Posts that are obviously trolling will be removed
- Should be obvious, but please don't troll the sub.

Feel free to speak your mind</h1>

<ul>
<li>This is a place where all who want to get something off their chest, can get something off their chest. The Mods at <a href=""/r/TrueOffMyChest"">/r/TrueOffMyChest</a> will never enforce any rules that exclude any race/gender/etc. or other views from posting in <a href=""/r/TrueOffMyChest"">/r/TrueOffMyChest</a>. We ask that you do the same.</li>
</ul>

<h1>2. Do not break sitewide rules</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Due to the nature of this subreddit, telling anyone to kill themselves will be an automatic, permanent ban. This is a place where people come to share some of their darkest secrets, things that might already put them into a volatile mental state. Again, there is a no tolerance policy for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Posts involving pedophilia or minors in sexual situations will likely be removed</p></li>
<li><p>Posts wishing violence on anyone will be removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Begging for karma is against Reddit ToS and will be removed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>3. Posts must be on topic</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>No Circlejerking - Repeated posts on the same topic within a 24 hour period is considered circlejerking. Please find an active thread on the topic and participate by commenting.</p></li>
<li><p>No blanket statements</p></li>
<li><p>No hot takes</p></li>
<li><p>No impersonal opinions, political or otherwise</p></li>
<li><p>No generalizations</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously fake stories will be removed</p></li>
<li><p>Political topics are fine but they must be in &quot;off my chest&quot; fashion.  </p></li>
<li><p>More information on what types of posts are allowed here:  <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/m501ud/what_does_personalized_off_my_chest_style_post/"">https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/m501ud/what_does_personalized_off_my_chest_style_post/</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h1>4. Comments must be civil and respectful of OP</h1>

<ul>
<li>Scolding/insults toward OP is not allowed, no matter what their opinions are. Egregiously breaking this rule may result in a ban.</li>
</ul>

<h1>5. Be mature</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Off-topic comments are rude and will be removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Calm debates are fine,  name-calling and arguing is not. Comments should be well-thought out and reasonable and have the goal of productive conversation with others, even if  there is a disagreement</p></li>
<li><p>Please engage the community in good faith and do not test the limits of the mod team</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>6. Do not disclose personal information about yourself or others</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Do not reveal personally identifiable information. Consider creating a new reddit account just for your post.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not attempt a witch hunt. This includes referencing another user&#39;s reddit history.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not ping users who are not already in the thread. Pinging someone in order to harass them is a bannable offense</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>7. Posts must be personal and in &quot;off my chest&quot; style</h1>

<ul>
<li>If your post isn&#39;t personal in nature or in &quot;off my chest&quot; style, it will be removed. If you want to talk about something, it either has to be directly related to you or directly impacting you - no soapboxing or hot takes/unpopular opinions.</li>
</ul>

<h1>8. No financial transactions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Do not offer money, give money, or request money. This is a bannable offensive with zero tolerance.</li>
</ul>

</div><!-- SC_ON -->",False,False,,True,False,False,False,Get something off your chest,left,,False,False,True,True,True,True,False,public,,,,,True,2yuqy,,False,,"# 1. Feel free to speak your mind 

* This is a place where all who want to get something off their chest, can get something off their chest. The Mods at /r/TrueOffMyChest will never enforce any rules that exclude any race/gender/etc. or other views from posting in /r/TrueOffMyChest. We ask that you do the same.

# 2. Do not break sitewide rules

* Due to the nature of this subreddit, telling anyone to kill themselves will be an automatic, permanent ban. This is a place where people come to share some of their darkest secrets, things that might already put them into a volatile mental state. Again, there is a no tolerance policy for this.

* Posts involving pedophilia or minors in sexual situations will likely be removed

* Posts wishing violence on anyone will be removed.

* Begging for karma is against Reddit ToS and will be removed.

# 3. Posts must be on topic

* No Circlejerking - Repeated posts on the same topic within a 24 hour period is considered circlejerking. Please find an active thread on the topic and participate by commenting.

* No blanket statements

* No hot takes

* No impersonal opinions, political or otherwise

* No generalizations

* Obviously fake stories will be removed

* Political topics are fine but they must be in ""off my chest"" fashion.  

* More information on what types of posts are allowed here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/m501ud/what_does_personalized_off_my_chest_style_post/

# 4. Comments must be civil and respectful of OP

* Scolding/insults toward OP is not allowed, no matter what their opinions are. Egregiously breaking this rule may result in a ban.

# 5. Be mature 


* Off-topic comments are rude and will be removed.

* Calm debates are fine,  name-calling and arguing is not. Comments should be well-thought out and reasonable and have the goal of productive conversation with others, even if  there is a disagreement

* Please engage the community in good faith and do not test the limits of the mod team

# 6. Do not disclose personal information about yourself or others 

* Do not reveal personally identifiable information. Consider creating a new reddit account just for your post.

* Do not attempt a witch hunt. This includes referencing another user's reddit history.

* Do not ping users who are not already in the thread. Pinging someone in order to harass them is a bannable offense

# 7. Posts must be personal and in ""off my chest"" style

* If your post isn't personal in nature or in ""off my chest"" style, it will be removed. If you want to talk about something, it either has to be directly related to you or directly impacting you - no soapboxing or hot takes/unpopular opinions.

# 8. No financial transactions

* Do not offer money, give money, or request money. This is a bannable offensive with zero tolerance.

<h2>CMH Rules &amp; Guidelines</h2>

<p><strong>1. Gentleness.</strong> Whether in a post, comment, or User Flair, speak gently, not abrasively. No profanity, slurs, blasphemy, bullying, trolling, or naming-names in a complaint (e.g. other subs/users).</p>

<p><strong>2. Oversimplifying.</strong> Avoid “waving the Magic Jesus Wand” at people. Healing is often complex, so statements like “Just pray more” or “Just give your heart to Jesus” can add feelings of guilt or failure to an already difficult burden.</p>

<p><strong>3. Humility.</strong> Share &amp; explain, don&#39;t declare &amp; debate. Instead of telling people what to do, try a &quot;stories, ideas, and options&quot; approach. When you&#39;re unsure what someone hopes for, ask and let <em>them</em> decide, then just listen and respond accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>4. Evangelism.</strong> Whatever faith you may practice, evangelizing is only fine <em>IF</em> it was invited by the other person.</p>

<p><strong>5. Self-help materials.</strong> Quoting/paraphrasing is fine! Promoting/advertizing is not.</p>

<p><strong>6. Editing.</strong> Comments can take lots of thought, heart, and work, and it&#39;s sad to feel misunderstood or wish you could take your own words back. So, edit freely whenever you need to, and allow for others who choose to do this as well.</p>

<p><strong>7. Privacy.</strong> Rather than initiating a PM, <em>comment</em> to the person on how you can relate to them, and ask if they&#39;d like to PM. Also, while &quot;context&quot; details like age/gender can aid discussion, sharing personal details like your name is unnecessary and risky.</p>

<p><strong>8. &quot;Experts.&quot;</strong> To post/comment while claiming “I&#39;m a licensed/certified expert,” contact the mods to get verified.</p>

<p><strong>9. Blogs, articles, &amp; other links.</strong> Any link conducive to the sub&#39;s purposes is welcome. If you <em>disagree with, question, or simply aren&#39;t sure about</em> material you want to link, make a self post and put the link in the text box.</p>

<p><strong>10. Discretion with greater Reddit.</strong> While this should be a safe place to express pain, links or explicit references to other Reddit subs/users can cause significant drama, as this sub is not private. So for links, use np.reddit (np.reddit.com<a href=""/r/SubredditName/postname"">/r/SubredditName/postname</a>), and use general references instead of names (&quot;another sub/thread/user&quot;).</p>

## CMH Rules & Guidelines



**1. Gentleness.** Whether in a post, comment, or User Flair, speak gently, not abrasively. No profanity, slurs, blasphemy, bullying, trolling, or naming-names in a complaint (e.g. other subs/users).

**2. Oversimplifying.** Avoid “waving the Magic Jesus Wand” at people. Healing is often complex, so statements like “Just pray more” or “Just give your heart to Jesus” can add feelings of guilt or failure to an already difficult burden.

**3. Humility.** Share & explain, don't declare & debate. Instead of telling people what to do, try a ""stories, ideas, and options"" approach. When you're unsure what someone hopes for, ask and let *them* decide, then just listen and respond accordingly.

**4. Evangelism.** Whatever faith you may practice, evangelizing is only fine *IF* it was invited by the other person.

**5. Self-help materials.** Quoting/paraphrasing is fine! Promoting/advertizing is not.

**6. Editing.** Comments can take lots of thought, heart, and work, and it's sad to feel misunderstood or wish you could take your own words back. So, edit freely whenever you need to, and allow for others who choose to do this as well.

**7. Privacy.** Rather than initiating a PM, *comment* to the person on how you can relate to them, and ask if they'd like to PM. Also, while ""context"" details like age/gender can aid discussion, sharing personal details like your name is unnecessary and risky.

**8. ""Experts.""** To post/comment while claiming “I'm a licensed/certified expert,” contact the mods to get verified.

**9. Blogs, articles, & other links.** Any link conducive to the sub's purposes is welcome. If you *disagree with, question, or simply aren't sure about* material you want to link, make a self post and put the link in the text box.

**10.

<hr/>

<h1>Rules</h1>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Be Respectful (No Personal Attacks/Witch-Hunts)</strong>
We’re here for discussion and debate, but we are not here for blatantly rude comments that some may consider offensive or harmful. Name-calling, homophobic, racist, sexist, and misogynistic posts will be automatically removed. Users will also be given warning via direct message when their comments are deemed inappropriate. Multiple warnings may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. When possible, we try to talk things through as adults first, before straight up banning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rule 2 - Keep it Hamilton Focused</strong>
This is a sub for the City of Hamilton, Ontario. Post about things happening in our community, newsworthy, events, and other helpful contributions often go a long way. Posts about neighbouring cities don’t tend to do well here, and we would consider posting in their appropriate sub. We also suggest using our “search” feature for commonly asked questions, like “I’m moving to Hamilton from…” or “where to find….” Often times, with a sub as old as ours, the questions have previously been answered. If you’re looking for Hamilton the Musical, we would consider posting to <a href=""/r/hamiltonmusical"">r/hamiltonmusical</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rule 3 - Slurs and/or Hate Speech</strong>
Hate speech is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as ”public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation”. - Such content will not be allowed on our sub, and is also part of reddit’s Global Content Policy. Hate is defined as: feel intense or passionate dislike for (someone)(verb) Or intense or passionate dislike (noun).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rule 4 - Security Camera Footage, Pictures Containing Faces (where consent wasn&#39;t given), Dash-Cams , Stolen Items, Missing Persons:</strong>
To help ensure privacy, prevent doxxing, personal attacks, and misinformation, and to also be respectful of a persons right to innocence until proven guilty, we cannot allow posts of these types to be shared in <a href=""/r/Hamilton"">r/Hamilton</a>. This is unless it comes from a police/government or news agency. If a photo contains a person/persons, and they did not verbally consent to having their picture taken, it is expected that the face be altered in such a way that the individuals not be easily identifiable. </p></li>
<li><p>Rule 5. <strong>Editorialized Headlines</strong>
When posting an article from an outside source, we ask that you leave the title of the original post as is, unless it is automatically populated incorrectly - at which point, we would ask that you take the heading/headline of that page and post it exactly as it appears. The reason for this is to ensure that the context in which the item was created is presented as it was meant to be displayed. Additional commentary or notes can always be added in the comment replies.</p></li>
<li><p>Rule 6. <strong>Spam/Obvious Self Promotions</strong>
Things that are obviously spam will be removed automatically. Same with obvious self-promotional plugs/videos. While things like car-washes, lemonade stands, and general event promotions are fine, these should be posted in our weekly Marketing Monday sticky. All promotions will be automatically flagged and will be reviewed by the mod team.</p></li>
<li><p>Rule 7. <strong>Reddiquette / Reddit Content Policy</strong>
Additionally, we suggest using Reddiquette and adhering to Reddit’s Global Content Policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rule 8 - Moderator Discretion</strong> 
Moderators retain discretion to remove a post at any time if they feel it is violating Reddit rules, or are intended to only incite abuse, are trolling, or are deemed offensive in some way. This includes, but is not limited to, reposts, hate messages, self-posts that cover already heavily discussed topics. The same rule also applies for suspicious karma farming posts and accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rule 9 - Contacting the Mods</strong>
When contacting the mods, we ask that you <a href=""https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Hamilton"">contact us via modmail</a> and not to our individual DM&#39;s or Chats. This ensures that all of the mod team can see your messages, and allows us to keep our personal accounts to ourselves. <strong>Any messages related to the business of our sub sent to our personal accounts will not be responded to.</strong></p></li>

<h5>Community Rules</h5>

<ol>
<li>Only Parents or Guardians May Create New Posts

<ul>
<li>Parents/guardians are any person who has substantial decision-making authority in a child&#39;s life. However, it’s okay for anyone to comment, provided it’s on-topic and within rules. Indicate you&#39;re a parent or guardian, or self-select your user flair, to avoid confusion/accidental moderation. Non-parents/guardians that still have pressing questions for parents can utilize the weekly &quot;Ask Parents Anything&quot; thread in this sub or visit <a href=""/r/AskParents"">r/AskParents</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be Decent &amp; Civil

<ul>
<li>Remember the Human! Disagree but remain respectful; don’t insult people or their children, name-call, or be intentionally rude. Bullying, including baiting/antagonizing, and brigading of either individual users or subreddits will not be tolerated. Reporting posts that violate this rule is the best way to get it noticed by the moderation team.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No Medical &amp; Legal Advice

<ul>
<li>Reddit and the internet, in general, are not the best places to get or give medical or legal advice. Support for established medical and legal situations is allowed. Do not ask about symptoms, post pictures, or ask if you should seek a medical professional. Do not ask if something is legal/illegal, if you should call the police, engage an attorney, or call child welfare agencies. Commenters should not offer medical or legal advice. Always consult a professional in these matters. Additionally, you may also consider posting on <a href=""/r/legaladvice"">r/legaladvice</a> for legal advice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No surveys, studies, or interviews

<ul>
<li>Absolutely no surveys, studies, petitions, interview requests or invitations to participate are permitted. This includes anything done for profit, academia, school, free, or for personal information. Please consider posting instead to <a href=""/r/samplesize"">r/samplesize</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No linking, promotion, or advertising

<ul>
<li>We do not allow spam, self-promotion, marketing research, fundraising, petitions, solicitation of feedback, or any material that looks to use the community for benefit of themselves or anybody else. Non-promotional linking is also discouraged, especially if it&#39;s the main focus of the submission.  This rule applies to both posts and comments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We are a discussion-first sub

<ul>
<li>This subreddit is discussion-based, and does not want blog posts, YouTube channels, open letters, pictures, or memes, or anything similar. This rule applies to posts and comments. Please check our <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits"">recommendation wiki</a> for other communities to post to.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No Sexual Content Involving Minors

<ul>
<li>Most content describing sexual acts that involve minors (even when no adults are involved) will usually be removed. Self-exploration and sex can be a normal part of human growth and development. If you are worried your child is outside the range of normal please see a professional for advice. If you are worried about the sexual abuse of a minor please see your child&#39;s doctor, local police, or child welfare agency as soon as possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>General Posting and Moderation

<ul>
<li>Moderators can remove or approve any content at their discretion. If you feel something of yours was erroneously removed - reach out. We&#39;d be glad to discuss it cordially. We only discuss moderation with the impacted user, not general curiosity seekers. Please help us by reporting posts and comments that don&#39;t meet the standard of our community for review!

/r/Parenting is a subreddit for anything related to the controlled chaos we call parenting. 

Do you have a question for parents?  Head over to /r/AskParents.  

Did your kid say something awesome?  Join us at /r/thingsmykidsaid.  

Are you a caregiver or nanny?  Check out /r/nanny.  

We also recommend /r/relationships, /r/legaladvice and /r/family. 

#####Community Rules
1. Only Parents or Guardians May Create New Posts
 * Parents/guardians are any person who has substantial decision-making authority in a child's life. However, it’s okay for anyone to comment, provided it’s on-topic and within rules. Indicate you're a parent or guardian, or self-select your user flair, to avoid confusion/accidental moderation. Non-parents/guardians that still have pressing questions for parents can utilize the weekly ""Ask Parents Anything"" thread in this sub or visit r/AskParents.
1. Be Decent & Civil
 * Remember the Human! Disagree but remain respectful; don’t insult people or their children, name-call, or be intentionally rude. Bullying, including baiting/antagonizing, and brigading of either individual users or subreddits will not be tolerated. Reporting posts that violate this rule is the best way to get it noticed by the moderation team.
1. No Medical & Legal Advice
 * Reddit and the internet, in general, are not the best places to get or give medical or legal advice. Support for established medical and legal situations is allowed. Do not ask about symptoms, post pictures, or ask if you should seek a medical professional. Do not ask if something is legal/illegal, if you should call the police, engage an attorney, or call child welfare agencies. Commenters should not offer medical or legal advice. Always consult a professional in these matters. Additionally, you may also consider posting on r/legaladvice for legal advice.
1. No surveys, studies, or interviews
 * Absolutely no surveys, studies, petitions, interview requests or invitations to participate are permitted. This includes anything done for profit, academia, school, free, or for personal information. Please consider posting instead to r/samplesize.
1. No linking, promotion, or advertising
 * We do not allow spam, self-promotion, marketing research, fundraising, petitions, solicitation of feedback, or any material that looks to use the community for benefit of themselves or anybody else. Non-promotional linking is also discouraged, especially if it's the main focus of the submission.  This rule applies to both posts and comments.
1. We are a discussion-first sub
 * This subreddit is discussion-based, and does not want blog posts, YouTube channels, open letters, pictures, or memes, or anything similar. This rule applies to posts and comments. Please check our [recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits) for other communities to post to.
1. No Sexual Content Involving Minors
 * Most content describing sexual acts that involve minors (even when no adults are involved) will usually be removed. Self-exploration and sex can be a normal part of human growth and development. If you are worried your child is outside the range of normal please see a professional for advice. If you are worried about the sexual abuse of a minor please see your child's doctor, local police, or child welfare agency as soon as possible.
1. General Posting and Moderation
 * Moderators can remove or approve any content at their discretion. If you feel something of yours was erroneously removed - reach out. We'd be glad to discuss it cordially. We only discuss moderation with the impacted user, not general curiosity seekers. Please help us by reporting posts and comments that don't meet the standard of our community for review! Your human moderators thank you for your patience and understanding.
1. **Rule P** - No Photos of Children
 * Sometimes you want to post a picture of your little one, maybe to illustrate something that's happened to them, or to just share!  We currently do not allow pictures of your little ones to be posted here, due to privacy and safety concerns.  Please check out our [recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits) for other communities to post to instead!
1. **Rule S** - Things My Kid Said Threads
 * We have the **""Things My Kid Said""** weekly thread about things your kids have said.  Please consider saving your submission for this thread instead!

<p>Speech-Language Pathologists, sometimes called speech therapists, assess, diagnose, treat, and help to prevent communication and swallowing disorders in patients. Speech, language, and swallowing disorders result from a variety of causes such as a stroke, brain injury, hearing loss, developmental delay, a cleft palate, cerebral palsy, or emotional problems. </p>

<p>Speech-language pathologists work with patients who have problems with speech, such as being unable to speak at all or speaking with difficulty, or with rhythm and fluency, such as stuttering. They may work with those who are unable to understand language or with people who have voice disorders, such as inappropriate pitch or a harsh voice.

<p><strong>The Microbiome Reddit</strong></p>

<p><strong>Microbiome</strong> - an &quot;ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms&quot; found in and on all multicellular organisms studied to date from plants to animals. A microbiota includes bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi and viruses. Microbiota have been found to be crucial for immunologic, hormonal and metabolic homeostasis of their host. The synonymous term microbiome describes either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that reside in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves.</p>

<p>The microbiome and host emerged during evolution as a synergistic unit from epigenetics and genomic characteristics, sometimes collectively referred to as a holobiont. </p>

**The Microbiome Reddit**

**Microbiome** - an ""ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms"" found in and on all multicellular organisms studied to date from plants to animals. A microbiota includes bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi and viruses. Microbiota have been found to be crucial for immunologic, hormonal and metabolic homeostasis of their host. The synonymous term microbiome describes either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that reside in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves.

The microbiome and host emerged during evolution as a synergistic unit from epigenetics and genomic characteristics, sometimes collectively referred to as a holobiont.

3) Good excelent to each other.

<h4>What is Peercoin?</h4>

<p>Peercoin is an efficient and sustainable, green cryptocurrency based on continuous limited inflation. It is the original pioneer of Proof of Stake.</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<ol>
<li>Launch &amp; Initial Distribution

<ul>
<li><strong>Launch:</strong> The Peercoin blockchain was originally <a href=""https://bit.ly/3fGLn32"">launched</a> on August 19th, 2012 by developers Sunny King and Scott Nadal, with no initial coin offering, premine, or developer tax. The project is completely open source and community driven.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Distribution:</strong> Peercoin was the first of its kind, a blockchain secured by Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, however Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining was originally used to fairly distribute the initial coin supply. Although it is decreasing in importance over time, PoW mining continues to provide a trickle of fresh coins. This has the effect of slowly decentralizing the blockchain over time by getting coins into the hands of new owners who can help secure the network via PoS minting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Efficient &amp; Sustainable Security

<ul>
<li><strong>Time as a Scarce Resource:</strong> The key innovation of Peercoin is its invention of PoS. PoW blockchains are secured by proving the consumption of a costly resource: electricity. PoS replaces this expensive security protocol by using an alternative scarce resource: time. The older your coins are, the more time they’ve accumulated sitting in your wallet, which gives them more power to participate in securing the network.</li>
<li><strong>Security with Low Power Devices:</strong> With PoS, you only need enough power to run your computer or laptop. This is possible because the network is secured through ownership of peercoins and the time they sit idle in your wallet, not by the wasteful and costly operation of mining equipment. This efficiency helps grow the number of security providers by making it more affordable to participate. Almost a decade after its launch, Peercoin continues to prove that energy efficient blockchain security is possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Benefits of Proof of Stake

<ul>
<li><strong>Aligning Security with Ownership:</strong> In PoW networks, miners can easily jump between whichever network is more profitable to mine, without any loyalty. In Peercoin however, the responsibility for security falls to the coin owners themselves, guaranteeing stakeholders have a vested interest in maintaining the network’s security.</li>
<li><strong>Geographical Decentralization:</strong> PoW mining concentrates power where electricity is cheapest, which compromises security, making it easier for local governments to target miners. By contrast, PoS minting can be done anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Price Independent Security:</strong> Unlike PoW miners, who rely on a positive asset price to cover their costs of operation and remain profitable, Peercoin minters benefit from the efficiency and lower costs of PoS. As a result, PoS minters are independent of price and can always secure the network with little expense to them.</li>
<li><strong>User Governance:</strong> Protocol rules are governed collectively by Peercoin’s users, making for a more democratic network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Limited Inflation Economics

<ul>
<li><strong>Continuous Limited Inflation:</strong> Many in crypto have a negative view toward inflation, resulting in the popularization of “deflationary,” fixed-supply economic models. At Peercoin however, inflation is viewed as a necessary element that contributes to the proper functioning of an economy. The problem stems from centrally controlled inflation, which can be excessive due to manipulation. The solution is not eliminating inflation entirely, but limiting and decentralizing it. This is the principle at the heart of Peercoin’s economic model, which targets an annual supply increase of around 2-3%. This mild inflation encourages circulation by providing a regulated and continuous stream of new coins into the hands of decentralized participants. As a counterbalance, transaction fees are burned, which acts as a downward force on the supply.</li>
<li><strong>Permanent Subsidy</strong> This annual inflation allows the Peercoin network to subsidize block producers with new coins, completely eliminating their reliance on transaction fees. The subsidy provides a permanent incentive for stakeholders to continuously produce new blocks. Personal minting rewards can range anywhere from 3% for periodic minters to 5% for continuous minters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trustless Settlement Layer

<ul>
<li><strong>Immutable Record Keeping:</strong> At its essence, a blockchain is a fully verifiable distributed public ledger which records data in a manner that prevents alterations. This tamper-proof system ensures stored data is immutable and requires less trust from users than third party intermediaries. The blockchain’s strength is primarily in permanent record keeping, rather than being used as a tool for daily payments. Transactions on the chain can be slow and expensive. This is solved with vertical and horizontal scaling technology, which offloads transactions onto separate off-chain networks built for high capacity processing. The blockchain plays the role of settlement layer by permanently recording the final result of these off-chain transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Built for Trustless Settlement:</strong> Blockchains that draw their security from transaction fees however are directly competing with the node operators of these off-chain networks. Fighting with off-chain nodes over the same fees is an incompatibility that will only starve block producers of potential revenue, resulting in reduced security for the blockchain. Since Peercoin is secured without any reliance on transaction fees, it is in complete alignment with off-chain networks, making it a better alternative to serve the role of a trustless settlement layer.</li>
</ul></li>

#### What is Peercoin?
Peercoin is an efficient and sustainable, green cryptocurrency based on continuous limited inflation. It is the original pioneer of Proof of Stake.

#### Overview
1. Launch & Initial Distribution
 * **Launch:** The Peercoin blockchain was originally [launched](https://bit.ly/3fGLn32) on August 19th, 2012 by developers Sunny King and Scott Nadal, with no initial coin offering, premine, or developer tax. The project is completely open source and community driven.
 * **Initial Distribution:** Peercoin was the first of its kind, a blockchain secured by Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, however Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining was originally used to fairly distribute the initial coin supply. Although it is decreasing in importance over time, PoW mining continues to provide a trickle of fresh coins. This has the effect of slowly decentralizing the blockchain over time by getting coins into the hands of new owners who can help secure the network via PoS minting.
2. Efficient & Sustainable Security
 * **Time as a Scarce Resource:** The key innovation of Peercoin is its invention of PoS. PoW blockchains are secured by proving the consumption of a costly resource: electricity. PoS replaces this expensive security protocol by using an alternative scarce resource: time. The older your coins are, the more time they’ve accumulated sitting in your wallet, which gives them more power to participate in securing the network.
 * **Security with Low Power Devices:** With PoS, you only need enough power to run your computer or laptop. This is possible because the network is secured through ownership of peercoins and the time they sit idle in your wallet, not by the wasteful and costly operation of mining equipment. This efficiency helps grow the number of security providers by making it more affordable to participate. Almost a decade after its launch, Peercoin continues to prove that energy efficient blockchain security is possible.
3. Benefits of Proof of Stake
 * **Aligning Security with Ownership:** In PoW networks, miners can easily jump between whichever network is more profitable to mine, without any loyalty. In Peercoin however, the responsibility for security falls to the coin owners themselves, guaranteeing stakeholders have a vested interest in maintaining the network’s security.
 * **Geographical Decentralization:** PoW mining concentrates power where electricity is cheapest, which compromises security, making it easier for local governments to target miners. By contrast, PoS minting can be done anywhere.
 * **Price Independent Security:** Unlike PoW miners, who rely on a positive asset price to cover their costs of operation and remain profitable, Peercoin minters benefit from the efficiency and lower costs of PoS. As a result, PoS minters are independent of price and can always secure the network with little expense to them.
 * **User Governance:** Protocol rules are governed collectively by Peercoin’s users, making for a more democratic network.
4. Limited Inflation Economics
 * **Continuous Limited Inflation:** Many in crypto have a negative view toward inflation, resulting in the popularization of “deflationary,” fixed-supply economic models. At Peercoin however, inflation is viewed as a necessary element that contributes to the proper functioning of an economy. The problem stems from centrally controlled inflation, which can be excessive due to manipulation. The solution is not eliminating inflation entirely, but limiting and decentralizing it. This is the principle at the heart of Peercoin’s economic model, which targets an annual supply increase of around 2-3%. This mild inflation encourages circulation by providing a regulated and continuous stream of new coins into the hands of decentralized participants. As a counterbalance, transaction fees are burned, which acts as a downward force on the supply.
 * **Permanent Subsidy** This annual inflation allows the Peercoin network to subsidize block producers with new coins, completely eliminating their reliance on transaction fees. The subsidy provides a permanent incentive for stakeholders to continuously produce new blocks. Personal minting rewards can range anywhere from 3% for periodic minters to 5% for continuous minters.
5. Trustless Settlement Layer
 * **Immutable Record Keeping:** At its essence, a blockchain is a fully verifiable distributed public ledger which records data in a manner that prevents alterations. This tamper-proof system ensures stored data is immutable and requires less trust from users than third party intermediaries. The blockchain’s strength is primarily in permanent record keeping, rather than being used as a tool for daily payments. Transactions on the chain can be slow and expensive. This is solved with vertical and horizontal scaling technology, which offloads transactions onto separate off-chain networks built for high capacity processing. The blockchain plays the role of settlement layer by permanently recording the final result of these off-chain transactions.
 * **Built for Trustless Settlement:** Blockchains that draw their security from transaction fees however are directly competing with the node operators of these off-chain networks. Fighting with off-chain nodes over the same fees is an incompatibility that will only starve block producers of potential revenue, resulting in reduced security for the blockchain. Since Peercoin is secured without any reliance on transaction fees, it is in complete alignment with off-chain networks, making it a better alternative to serve the role of a trustless settlement layer.
6. Development Roadmap
 * Full details can be found [here](https://bit.ly/3rQpTDe). The following is a brief summary of Peercoin's 2021 roadmap.
 * **Core Development**
 * **v0.10 - Codename: Scarab:**
 * New codebase (based on bitcoin-core 0.20)
 * **v0.11 - Codename: Tardigrade:**
 * [RFC-0012](https://bit.ly/3wtc4yk) (Cold minting)
 * [RFC-0014](https://github.com/peercoin/rfcs/blob/master/text/0014-transaction-timestamp/0014-transaction-timestamp.md) (Removal of the transaction timestamp for non-coinstake transactions)
 * [RFC-0020](https://bit.ly/3mloHqh) (Proof-of-Work Difficulty on PoS Blocks)
 * **Non-Core Development**
 * Peercoin <-> Ethereum Bridge
 * Android/iOS Mobile Apps
 * Rosetta Integration
 * **Donate:** These developments are sponsored by the Peercoin Foundation, which in turn is sponsored by generous community donations. PPC, BTC, and fiat can be donated at [peercoin.net/foundation](https://bit.ly/3fEq3eH).

**About CSP**



* People with CSP feel compelled to pick at real or perceived blemishes (acne, dry skin, callouses, or other textural anomalies); resisting these urges is akin to resisting the urge to cough or to scratch an itch.

* CSP is an Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorder, and  sometimes also referred to as dermatillomania.  In the DSM-5, it is called ""Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder"".

* Engaging in these compulsions can lead to pain, infections, scarring, and social stigma, as well as feelings of shame, guilt, and depression.

* Treatments exist for CSP, and they involve hard work in therapy aimed at reducing the frequency and duration of picking episodes. Medications may help, but there are no cures.

<p><strong>RULES</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>.Always be kind and considerate.</p>

<p><em>Here are some tips:</em><br/>
- <em>Think before you type.</em><br/>
- <em>Consider the true intention of your words.</em><br/>
- <em>Assume others&#39; intentions are positive.</em><br/>
- <em>Assume any unkindness you find is because someone has had a bad day.</em><br/>
- <em>Welcome dissent and assume it&#39;s constructive.</em><br/>
- <em>Welcome different ways of speaking beside your own.</em><br/>
- <em>If you make a mistake, own up to it.</em><br/>
- <em>If you&#39;re unsure if you should post, give it another day.</em><br/>
- <em>If you&#39;re still unsure, don&#39;t post.</em></p>

<p><em>This community has 0 tolerance for discrimination, regardless of whether the person facing moderation believes the subject is political or up for debate. Discriminatory posts/comments will be moderated according to rule 3.</em></p>

<p><em>Posts that are controversial will be moderated more heavily for this rule.</em></p>

<p><strong>2</strong>.Observe the Social Model of Disability.</p>

<p><em>The model explains that a person is only disabled by barriers society created. Thus it&#39;s society&#39;s obligation to remove the barriers to create a more equal society for everyone, not just its &#39;typical&#39; members.</em></p>

<p><em>It isn&#39;t a perfect model for how society should consider the neurodiverse, but it does instruct us not to suggest a person&#39;s difficulties are only theirs to overcome. Do encourage others to communicate with the people around them.</em></p>

<p><em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability</a></em></p>

<p><strong>3</strong>.Is this post right for <a href=""/r/autismUK"">r/autismUK</a>?</p>

<p><em>You should use your best judgement to decide if your posts are suitable for the community. Moderators will do the same to decide whether your post is acceptable.</em></p>

<p><em>This should be a common sense judgment in most cases, but where you are not sure, you will want to lean toward caution when deciding. You are welcome to message the moderators for advice.</em></p>

<p><em>Some examples of inappropriate posts:</em> 
- <em>discussions of pseudo-science, or &#39;cures&#39;</em> 
- <em>discrimination of any kind</em> 
- <em>links to blogs whose purpose is to get you to use their affiliate links</em> 
- <em>using sources which are heavily biased or discriminatory</em>
- <em>using sources whose facts cannot be proved or are disproved</em></p>

<p>What will happen to posts that are moderated for this rule? </p>

<p><em>In many cases, the post will be locked, all comments deleted, and the post&#39;s flair will be changed to reflect what is inappropriate about the post. This is to help educate the community, it is not a reflection of any attitude toward the poster themself. An explanation for how the post is inappropriate will be left in the comments.</em></p>

<p><em>New types of inappropriate posts will be recorded on a wiki page.</em></p>

<p><em>Posts that are not kept for education purposes, and all comments, will be deleted.</em></p>

<p><strong>4</strong>.Self Promotion</p>

<p><em>Self-promotion is not permitted unless you can demonstrate that you are an active participant in the community. This means you must use text posts to self-promote and you can only post your promotion in the comment. Text posts require a minimum of 500 characters to post.</em></p>

<p><em>Self-promoters breaking this rule will have their posts deleted and the URLs from their links blacklisted from post content.</em></p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p><em>Because the UK&#39;s autistic population isn&#39;t here to provide you with likes, subs, or karma. We understand that making your work can be a valid way of processing your life experience and a means of passing on your hard-won insights, but when you aren&#39;t an active member of the community it makes us feel used, targetted, and harassed.</em> </p>

<p><em>We do understand that it&#39;s not easy for all our members to be verbose, but in order to require self-promoters to participate, we have to require the minimum limit for everyone.</em> </p>

<p>As a child, you are dependent on your parent being able to interpret your emotional state. When you are pre-verbal as well as when you are very young. You need your parent to help you, soothe you, support and socialize you. </p>

<p><strong>Healthy families</strong></p>

<p>In healthy families, where a parent has autism, the parent often understands that he or she has limitations. He or she generally knows and accepts that there are things (s)he is not good at, and will generally receive support from non-autistic adults, like their spouse, to help compensate for their deficits. Both the autistic partner and non-autistic spouse communicate well, despite neurological differences, and the family is gererally very loving and happy. Children of autistic parents from healthy families generally discover later in life that their parent was struggling and may have some difficulties connecting with their parent at times, but in general look back on a loving, if a little weird, childhood. </p>

<p><strong>Dysfunctional families</strong></p>

<p>In dysfunctional families, where a parent has autism, the parent either does not understand or refuses to acknowledge that he or she has limitations. Both partners in the relationship tend to blame the other for difficulties. There is a lot of fighting and children feel unloved and unsupported. Many children feel at a young age that something is &#39;wrong&#39;. Often they discover autism later in life and struggle with immense loneliness. In these families, the child is unseen and unsupported, because the parents are too busy fighting to get themselves heard, without listening to the other person. If there are circumstances contributing to a dysfunctional family dynamic, there can be (unintended but real and often significant) emotional and psychological damage to the child. Need to vent, want to know if someone else experienced the same or wish to understand more about what autism means for your family? This can hopefully become the place to do that..</p>

<p><strong>Average</strong></p>

<p>Somewhere in the middle are functioning, but generally emotionally very empty families. Children from these families struggle with having had a &#39;decent&#39; upbringing, but feeling very, very lonely. Depression is a common mental health issue.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with grief and anger and finding mutual understanding</strong></p>

<p>Children from these three family dynamics have very different experiences and very different views of autism. For children from dysfunctional families, often there is heavy trauma and complicated grief that hardly dissipates with time. For children from both dysfunctional and &#39;average&#39; family, there is often an intense feeling of loneliness. There is furthermore a lot of anger at never having been seen or heard as a child. </p>

<p>If we do not deal with this grief we lump all autistic people in a bin and project all our anger on all autistic people. For people coming from healthy, loving families, this may be very difficult to see happening. Please understand that this is often part of the grieving process. </p>

<p>If you come from a loving family and want to help, please share your stories. </p>

<p>Savant is the dubstep/complextro alias of the Norwegian artist Aleksander
Vinter.  </p>

thinks out songs in seconds and produces them within few hours. 
To this date
Aleksander has composed/produced over 10,000 songs in various genres, most
notably metal, orchestral/classical, hip-hop and electronic music. Aleksander
also draws inspiration from early game music such as NES, Sega, Commodore 64,
Amiga, Atari and SNES. Being such a unique producer; open minded people embrace
him and the weekly free music, though critics tend to critique the quantity and
the fast rate of releases. </p>

<p>In 2009, he released his debut album, <em>Outbreak</em>, under the Vinter in Hollywood
alias. Outbreak was nominated in the electronic music category for the 2009
Norwegian Grammy Awards. </p>

<p>Vinter signed with SectionZ Records in 2010 and released <em>Mamachine</em> under the
alias Vinter in Vegas and in 2011, <em>Ninür</em> under Savant. </p>

<p>2012 was his most prolific year in terms of full projects: <em>Vario</em>, <em>Overworld</em>, <em>ISM</em> and <em>Alchemist</em> all contain over 12 tracks each, and represent Savant&#39;s first boom in popularity.
Starting from <em>Vario</em>, no record would shy away from Bandcamp&#39;s #1 spot.</p>

<p>In 2013, his following increased as he embarked on two North American tours.
Between tours he released the album <em>Cult</em> and provided music for the D-Pad
Studio game Savant – Ascent. <em>Orakel</em> was released on December 11, 2013 and
reached the #3 spot on the iTunes Dance charts in the US. </p>

<p>In 2014, Savant released <em>Protos</em>, which reached #24 on the North American
iTunes Pop charts and #1 on the Bandcamp Electronica and Overall charts. Later
that year, on December 13, 2014, <em>Zion</em> was released, peaking at #2 on the
holiday iTunes Dance chart in the US. <em>Zion</em> also reached #19 on the Billboard
Dance chart and #24 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. </p>

<p><em>Invasion</em> was released in January 2015, and led deadmau5 to call
Savant “the change that electronic dance music needs”.
He also released the <em>Bajo EP</em> under his old alias of Blanco, mixing &quot;Latin, African, Arabic, European and Asian music&quot;.</p>

<p>In 2016 Vinter worked on singles for the highly anticipated Vex. These are: <em>Fire</em>, <em>Cassette</em>, <em>Savior</em> and <em>Forsaken</em>. <em>Get It Get It</em>, featuring DMX and Snoop Dogg, is his standalone single for 2016. Later that year <em>Vybz</em> came out again under Savant, as well as a semi-unmastered collection of unreleased tracks called <em>Outcasts</em>.</p>

<p>In 2017, he brought back his old hip-hop alias: Datakrash, with the release of the <em>Savage EP</em> and the <em>90&#39;s Babies</em> collab with co-label artist and friend, ToBy. Along with the reactivation of his SoundCloud page, Vinter is offered to work on the soundtrack for <em>The Black Room</em>, a film directed by Rolfe Kanefsky. The OST was released on Savant&#39;s bandcamp page on March 11.
Following this, he also put out a Savant record called <em>Jester</em>, reaching #1 on Bandcamp once again.
In the latter months of 2017, Aleks resurrected yet another alias, &quot;Vinter&quot;, releasing the single <em>Online</em>.</p>

<p>In 2018, Aleks is offered to work on the soundtrack of a still unnamed &quot;Savant RPG&quot; game.
He also released a celtic-inspired record called <em>Highlander</em> under his own name in March and remastered <em>Jester</em> shortly after.</p>

 Savant is the dubstep/complextro alias of the Norwegian artist Aleksander
Vinter.  


He is a prodigious savant with Asperger's syndrome and a fracture of ADD. He
thinks out songs in seconds and produces them within few hours. 
To this date
Aleksander has composed/produced over 10,000 songs in various genres, most
notably metal, orchestral/classical, hip-hop and electronic music. Aleksander
also draws inspiration from early game music such as NES, Sega, Commodore 64,
Amiga, Atari and SNES. Being such a unique producer; open minded people embrace
him and the weekly free music, though critics tend to critique the quantity and
the fast rate of releases. 


In 2009, he released his debut album, *Outbreak*, under the Vinter in Hollywood
alias. Outbreak was nominated in the electronic music category for the 2009
Norwegian Grammy Awards. 


Vinter signed with SectionZ Records in 2010 and released *Mamachine* under the
alias Vinter in Vegas and in 2011, *Ninür* under Savant. 

2012 was his most prolific year in terms of full projects: *Vario*, *Overworld*, *ISM* and *Alchemist* all contain over 12 tracks each, and represent Savant's first boom in popularity.
Starting from *Vario*, no record would shy away from Bandcamp's #1 spot.

In 2013, his following increased as he embarked on two North American tours.
Between tours he released the album *Cult* and provided music for the D-Pad
Studio game Savant – Ascent. *Orakel* was released on December 11, 2013 and
reached the #3 spot on the iTunes Dance charts in the US. 

In 2014, Savant released *Protos*, which reached #24 on the North American
iTunes Pop charts and #1 on the Bandcamp Electronica and Overall charts. Later
that year, on December 13, 2014, *Zion* was released, peaking at #2 on the
holiday iTunes Dance chart in the US. *Zion* also reached #19 on the Billboard
Dance chart and #24 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. 

*Invasion* was released in January 2015, and led deadmau5 to call
Savant “the change that electronic dance music needs”.
He also released the *Bajo EP* under his old alias of Blanco, mixing ""Latin, African, Arabic, European and Asian music"".

In 2016 Vinter worked on singles for the highly anticipated Vex. These are: *Fire*, *Cassette*, *Savior* and *Forsaken*. *Get It Get It*, featuring DMX and Snoop Dogg, is his standalone single for 2016. Later that year *Vybz* came out again under Savant, as well as a semi-unmastered collection of unreleased tracks called *Outcasts*.

The OST was released on Savant's bandcamp page on March 11.
