**Microbiome** - ""the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space."" This term was originally coined by Joshua Lederberg, who argued the importance of microorganisms inhabiting the human body in health and disease.

The human body contains over 10 times more microbial cells than human cells, although the entire microbiome only weighs about 200 grams (7.1 oz), with some weight estimates ranging as high as 3 pounds (approximately 48 ounces or 1,400 grams). Some consider it to be a ""newly discovered organ"" since its existence was not generally recognized until the late 1990s and it is understood to potentially have overwhelming impact on human health.[8] Modern DNA sequencing techniques have enabled researchers to find the majority of these microbes, since the majority of them cannot be cultured in a lab using current techniques. 

The human microbiome may be implicated in auto-immune diseases like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, and perhaps some cancers. Common obesity might also be aggravated by a poor mix of microbes in the gut. Since some of the microbes in our body can modify the production of neurotransmitters known to be found in the brain, we may also find some relief for schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder and other neuro-chemical imbalances.

**Microbiomes** are being characterized in many other environments as well, including soil, seawater and freshwater systems. It is believed that endosymbiosis originally gave rise to more complex organisms, and continued to play a fundamental role in guiding their evolution and expansion into new niches.
The microbes being discussed are generally non-pathogenic (do not cause disease unless they grow abnormally); they exist in harmony and symbiotically with their hosts.

Researchers have learned that much of the population of microbes found in the human body are not bacteria but a very old class of single-celled organisms called [archaea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea).

---

**2) Keep discussion friendly, civil, courteous, and professional.** We're here to help so being rude won't help. Dont assume a shop is trying to ""rip you off."" It's okay to ask for a second opinion.

**Golden Rule: If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all.** **Those who demonstrate they cannot follow the rules will be warned and posts removed. Those who continually cause issue will be removed**

---
**3)** Only one vehicle/problem/incident per thread, and only post once. If you didn't get an answer the first time, or you don't like the answer you got that does not mean you post it again. Do not post asking questions of your own in someone else's post

The only exception is for posting updates, provided it is properly marked as an [Update] or similar.

---
Asking for an estimate in r/autobody is against there rules. If you have insurance/total loss questions please ask in r/insurance.

---

#RIP-OFFS, SCAMS, & SECOND OPINIONS

You may ask a second opinion on a quote/repair from a shop.  However, please observe rule #1 when asking for a second opinion.  It is considered rude to ask, “Is the shop trying to fleece/rip me off?”  You wouldn’t ask “Why are all cops pigs?” on /r/AskLeo, ask about Creationism on /r/AskScience, or talk about vaccines causing autism on /r/AskDocs.

Generally there is a good reason why a repair costs what it does.  We are more than happy to help you figure out why a shop wants to charge you for a repair, and we will tell you if it is unusually high.  We are also happy to advise on how you can save money at the shop.  *Please read the [sticky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/4qblei/fyi_the_shop_isnt_likely_trying_to_rip_you_off/) on the subject for details.*

This group is an extension of the Facebook group - https://www.facebook.com/groups/noisefloorav/

Rules:

1 - The number 1 rule is to always be respectful. Period.

2 - The second rule is to keep an open mind. If you see someone offering a tip that you think is stupid, you can let that be known without being high and mighty about it. Just because you may not do it, doesn't mean it can't (or shouldn't) be done by someone else.

3 - The third rule is to keep your posts related to the subject of the group, which is audio and video production. This can include all aspects of audio and video production, including the business side of those worlds. However, posts about which album you think is awesome or which band shouldn't have been on warped tour do not belong on this group. We're here to have grown up discussions about how to do our jobs.

4 - The fourth rule is that you must respect the fact that this group has professionals who get paid for their time and expertise. Asking if anyone can edit your drum tracks for free is disrespectful to those individuals. If you ask if anyone wants drum tracks to practice editing on, and a newer engineer sees that as an ideal opportunity for them to practice their drum editing skills, that's perfectly fine. But if you come here and say ""I need these drums edited, but I have zero budget. Who can help me?"", I'll ban you. Those of us who earn our living doing this do not appreciate having our work undermined and disrespected. Be mindful of that.

5 - The 5th rule is that we don't care about your band. If you post in here that your band just released a new single, and then you walk away without discussing the production of that single, I'll assume you're posting band spam and ban you. We've all got musical projects we're working on, and this isn't the place to promote those projects.

6 - The 6th rule is that you can ask for mix critiques, but if you do ask then be mindful of rule number 4. Many of the people in this group who may have the most valuable input may have very little time to critique your mix. Some of us are willing, but have very little time to do so. So be aware that you run the risk of getting critiques from people who aren't as experienced in this group if you ask for critiques. We encourage everyone to take part in the discussion, but be mindful of that fact.

7 - The 7th rule is that you are allowed to promote your products here. If you, yourself, had a hand in producing a sample pack or a plugin and you wanna tell us about it, you can do so. Don't do this too often, as it'll be looked at as spam. If the only thing you post on this group is an ad for your product over and over again over a period of time, it'll be clear to us that you're not trying to contribute to the discussions here and are merely trying to advertise. We're trying to build a learning community, not another ad wall.

8 - The 8th rule is to understand that I, Brandon S. Hire, will do my best to interact with all of you. However, the demands of raising two teens on the autism spectrum are more important than this forum. I may appear stressed at times, and I may never have time to listen to something you'd like my input on. It's not personal. Far from it. I want to interact with all of you, which is why I'm pulling you here. But I've got a lot on my plate, and have priorities that trump Facebook in my personal life. Be respectful of that please.

With that said, I'm just a guy who has a DAW. Same as you. My aim is to create a group where everyone is treated equally and respectfully. I don't care if you're Bob Rock, or some teenager who is cutting demos with reaper on a laptop in his bedroom, you've both got something in common. You're humans, and you're interested in the same thing. You both deserve the same amount of respect, and you will get that in this group if you give it in this group.

**Welcome!** This is a community meant for a discussion of [Schizophrenia](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/53xfmu/frequently_asked_questions_read_this_sticky/)  and schizophrenia related issues (including psychotic symptoms in general, Schizoid, Schizotypal, and Paranoid Personality Disorders). Feel free to post, discuss, or just lurk. There is no judgement in this place: we are here for each other. Please refrain from self-diagnosis, diagnosing others, or advising specific medical treatments.

[Read the sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/53xfmu/frequently_asked_questions_read_this_sticky/) and if your question is answered fully by it, **your post may be removed**.

***************************************************

**Rules**

Nobody is judged here for having symptoms of schizophrenia, so please do not feel embarrassed or afraid to post: being able to interact with others while one is having a tough time is very important.

However, the following rules will be enforced strictly:

1. Do not use hate speech or attack others.

2. Do not encourage suicide, self harm, or illegal or harmful activity.

3. Do not encourage delusions. This includes reinforcing shared delusions.

4. Do not contraindicate prescribed medical treatments. This includes advice to cease medication on one's own or to take drugs without a prescription.

5. Do not perpetuate stigma. This includes any grossly misleading or offensive statements about people with schizophrenia.

6. Do not solicit responses for polls, surveys, interviews, and/or studies. If you are looking to conduct an interview for school or a writing project (not a formal study), refer to [our list](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/wiki/writers) of consenting users.

7. Questionable activity. We reserve the right to remove questionable posts for the sake of community safety and to prevent spam, including removing questions of whether a user has schizophrenia or posts dealing with political and religious themes. If you see something questionable, please use the report function and modmail us so we can handle it.

This community is welcoming; hate speech and abusiveness will never be tolerated. Offenders will be banned at the discretion of the mods.

##**Guidelines**

###Titles must be properly formatted.

> **[Tag] Topic (Demographic)**  

> If your title doesn't match up with the guidelines it will be removed.

>> Here are some examples:

>> * [Casual] Favorite Ice Cream (US 18+)
* [Results] What do you take in your coffee (Canadians 19-37)
* [Academic] Handedness (All welcome)

>> Here are the pieces of the title:

>> **[Tag]** - [Casual], [Academic], or [Marketing] for surveys. [Meta] for discussion of survey methodology. [Results] for posts sharing the results of a previously posted survey. **Choose only one tag.**

>> **Topic** - Topic of your survey (""survey for my english class"" is **not** an adequate description).

>> **(Demographic)** - Who you want to answer your survey; age, country, characteristics, etc. Let potential respondents know whether they should participate (required even if your survey is open to everybody). 

>>  If you're confused about the rules, [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSampleSize) and ask questions!

### Reposting

> Please feel free to repost your survey ***after*** 24 hours have passed, AND it has fallen off of the front page.

>> Please add **[Repost]** to your original title to prevent getting duplicate respondents. It'll look like this:

>> **[Repost][Casual] Favourite Colour? (All)**  

>> If you repost your survey within 24 hours of your last post, it will be removed. Please remember to repost within reason.

###Gender / Sex

> When asking about gender or sex, **include ""another gender"" and/or a ""fill in the blank"" option** if your demographic is for (Everyone). 

>> This helps with data integrity, and it also helps with inclusion. More people than you might think would fill out ""other"" on a gender question! If you are strictly interested in only people who identify as Male or Female, make sure you use (M/F) in your demographic.

### Race / Ethnicity

> If you are asking about **race and/or ethnicity** in your survey, please know [the differences between them](http://web.archive.org/web/20151028182449/http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/reic/definitions.asp). 

>> Race refers to physical characteristics that one shares with other people of one's race, while ethnicity refers to one's culture and traditions. If you mix these up, you once again may run into data integrity issues!

### Ethical implications and consent

> Don't forget to consider [ethical implications and consent](http://inside.bard.edu/irb/consent/) for your research.

>> If you require signed consent from a moderator before posting your survey, feel free to [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSampleSize) and we would be happy to help you out.

### Commenting and Behaviour

> Please refrain from soliciting participants in the comments section of other surveys. 

>> The discussion section for each thread is for comments about that survey. If you see people doing this, feel free to report the comment, and we'll remove it and talk to them about it.

##**Flair for Posts**

You can tag your surveys as [Casual] [Academic] or [Marketing] and then people can search on them!

####[Casual](/r/SampleSize/search?q=flair:'Casual'&restrict_sr=on&sort=new)

####[Academic](/r/SampleSize/search?q=flair:'Academic'&restrict_sr=on&sort=new)

####[Marketing](/r/SampleSize/search?q=flair:'Marketing'&restrict_sr=on&sort=new)

Everybody likes to see survey results! If you are able to post the results of your survey, please use a **[Results]** tag on that post, and please use link flair on your results. Just click on the ""flair"" link underneath your post to get [this dialog box](http://i.imgur.com/0YM2ybw.png) and select ""Results"".  

We are now awarding user flair for those who take the time to post some interesting results. If you posted prior to the implementation, or if we missed your results post, message the mods with a link to your results submission.

####[Show Results](/r/SampleSize/search?q=flair:'Results'&restrict_sr=on&sort=new)

##**Resources**

### Self Post vs. Survey

> Post your survey using a survey tool instead of merely asking a question in a text-only post. People are more likely to respond!

""Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), previously known as Devic's disease, is a central nervous system disorder that primarily affects the eye nerves (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis). Now known in broader terms as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, NMO occurs when your body's immune system reacts against its own cells in the central nervous system, mainly in the optic nerves and spinal cord, but sometimes in the brain.

The cause of neuromyelitis optica is usually unknown, although it may sometimes appear after an infection, or it may be associated with another autoimmune condition. Neuromyelitis optica is often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS) or perceived as a type of MS, but NMO is a distinct condition."" -Mayo Clinic

r/TrueUnpopularOpinion aims to be a space for civil discussion of unpopular opinions, free of some of the censorship found on many other subreddits.

However, Reddit's sitewide TOS still applies.

**[CLICK HERE TO FILTER OUT POLITICAL POSTS](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/search?q=flair_name%3A%22N%C2%AD%C2%ADon-Political%22&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)**

Rules
---
**1. Posts must be opinions**

Opinions are subjective statements that cannot easily be proven true or false.

**2. Opinions must be unpopular**

Opinions must be unpopular among a certain group of people, specified by post flair. For example, opinions that are only unpopular on Reddit should be flared as [Unpopular on Reddit]. However, non-political posts should be flaired as such regardless of popularity.

This rule is not aggressively enforced since what is and isn't popular is very disputable. For more information about how we enforce this rule, see this post: https://www.reddit.com/14idvha

**3. No low-effort posts**

Give a well thought-out opinion and explanation. You don't need to write a novel, but at least put a few sentences of elaboration in the text body.

**4. Keep discussion civil**

Engage in honest, respectful discussions. Do not personally attack or mock people. If you believe that OP's opinion is stupid/uninformed/offensive, then attack the opinion on its merits.

For a full explanation about what we do or don't consider a violation, see this post: https://www.reddit.com/zw3s5g

**5. No spam or trolling**

Keep all discussion on topic. Do not post content designed primarily to anger users or to elicit a desired reaction from users. Do not spam.

**6. Meta posts should start with ""[Meta]""**

Meta posts relate to this subreddit and do not have to follow rule 1 or 2.

**7. No racism or sexism. Follow Reddit's TOS.**

For more information about Reddit's TOS, please see this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/ncm4ou/

**8. Use the report button appropriately**

You should only report a post or comment if you believe it violates our rules or Reddit's TOS. Do not use the report button as a downvote button.

If a user abuses the report button, we WILL flag their reports, and this very often results in their account being suspended from all of Reddit.

If you would like to bring our attention to any post or comment but you are unsure if it violates the rules or the proper report reason is not available, please send us a modmail instead of reporting it.

When you do make reports, make sure that your report the correct post or comment with the correct report reason.

This subReddit was created by the operator of 
[AvoidSuicide.com](http://AvoidSuicide.com) & [MyLifeIssues.org](http://mylifeissues.org) and the host of the new [Suicide Prevention Podcast](http://SuicidePreventionPodcast.org). 

We also recently started a new subReddit: r/SuicidalPeople, similar to r/SuicideWatch, but where all types of (non-religious) positive responses are encouraged -- by anyone from therapists to psychiatrists to life coaches to caring individuals who simply want to offer their thoughts, advice or encouragement.

**Suicide Prevention Research & Resources**

/r/SuicidePreventionRes

---

***We'd like to invite*** suicidologists, suicide researchers, suicide prevention professionals and volunteers, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, students -- and anyone else with an interest in understanding and preventing suicide -- to post and share links and resources HERE, or on our other subReddit: /r/AvoidSuicide

*Know someone in suicide prevention? Share:*
www.reddit.com/r/SuicidePreventionRes

---

Also, professionals and volunteers alike are encouraged to respond/relate on r/suicidewatch or r/SuicidalPeople (our new subReddit). *You could help save a life today!*
 
---

Like /r/suicidology ... **This subReddit is devoted to understanding and preventing suicide.** 

Suicidology is defined as the study of suicide and suicide prevention. However, because some people see suicidology as the objective study of suicide (whether pro or con), the /r/suicidology subReddit has had issues with pro-suicide postings, and has had to change their moderation polices to keep it more focused on suicide prevention.
 
Since this subReddit has the word 'prevention' in the title, the hope is that it can remain focused on research and info that helps **prevent suicide**, rather than discussions about the pros and cons or rightness/wrongness of committing suicide. 
 
While there may be nothing inherently 'wrong' about an individual choosing to end their life, and the creator/moderator(s) of this subReddit are not taking a position against an individual's right to die; because the personal issues involved are often very complex; and because it is believed that the majority of suicidal people would much prefer to improve their lives and continue living if that were possible; and because many people who were once extremely suicidal have gone on to live happy, healthy, productive lives; the goal of this subReddit is to do everything possible to encourage people to stay alive and to promote all methods of suicide prevention that may help suicidal people overcome their struggles, rebuild their lives, and ultimately find the peace, happiness and fulfillment that all of us as humans long for.

#Guidelines#

1.  **This is a place of support.**  All the following ways of responding to at-risk OPs are strictly forbidden. If you see anything like this in a post or comment, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch).      
     * **Abuse or ""tough love""** ***including any guilt-tripping like ""suicide is selfish"" or ""think of your loved ones""***.      
     * **Pro-Suicide Posts or Comments,** ***or any explicit discussion of suicide methods***       
     * **Religious proselytizing**  
     * **Trolling or incitement to suicide or any type of self-harm or violence**    
     * **Anything that's not a direct, personal, supportive response to the OP.**

1.  **Please note that we are NOT a hotline!** We do NOT have the ability to trace the source of any posts, and we can't guarantee immediate responses. 

1.  **We offer non-judgemental peer support ONLY.**  The only requirement to respond here is genuine concern, so please don't take anything you read here as professional advice. It's fine to share what worked for you, but **DO NOT advocate for or against any specific type of therapy, self-help strategy, or medication, especially street drugs or alcohol, and DO NOT diagnose people** 

1.  **If you're here to help please respond** ***publicly*** **to our OPs in need.**  Sort by ""new"" and check for posts with few or no good responses.  The rules below link to posts with details.     
     * [Posts shouldn't include or request contact information.](http://redd.it/dmu24)  
     * [Don't ""advertise"" yourself as a helper, authority, or role model.  This includes inviting private contact as a first resort.](http://redd.it/xgrba)
     * [Do NOT post general ""uplifting"" or anti-suicide messages. Encouragement should never be offered until you've demonstrated understanding of the OP's emotions and experience, to ***their*** satisfaction, not yours! This also means no fundraising or activism, please.](http://redd.it/1cep2h) 
     * [Please, **never make promises to our vulnerable OPs that you personally can't keep**.  This means ***not*** saying ""it gets better"" or guaranteeing any outcomes!  It also means not to make any ""supportive"" but unverifiable assertions about the OP, i.e. telling them they're a good/strong/etc. person.](http://redd.it/25igd7)

1.  **We err on the side of safety**. If we need to remove a post or comment from someone who's reached out for help, we'll let them know why we removed it and how they can change it.  If this happens to you, please know that we **do** want to talk to you.  

1.  **If you need help but don't feel comfortable making a post** for any reason, please [**message the moderators**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch).  We will be glad to talk with you privately, or help in any other way that we can.

* [Take Jury Duty! Understand Jury Nullification. Stanhope Explains.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1k4fYIUuAP8)

* It is 100% legal to openly record police in all 50 states as long as you do not physically interfere with the officer. (It's also probably wise to speak as little as possible, but DO make note of details - location, names, etc) 

* Police officers do not have a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" while preforming their public duties.

* If an officer says it's illegal to record him, that officer is lying to try and trick you into shutting off the camera so you won't have proof of them violating your rights.

* Use a livestreaming app to record your videos. If your phone is seized, the police cannot delete the video because the video was never on the phone to begin with.

##Rules

###Rule 1: We are good to each other.

We respect each other. If you encounter someone breaking this rule, disengage and report them.

We do not insult, antagonize, interrogate, invalidate, or criticize the original poster (OP), even when not directly addressing OP.

### Rule 2: No oppressive attitudes and language.

We do not tolerate oppressive attitudes and language. This includes but is not limited to content we determine to be sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, classist, ableist, or intolerant of non-dominant religions.

Slut-shaming, victim-blaming, and body-policing are unsafe actions.

Suicide guilting is not allowed. Follow best practices when encountering people at-risk.

No proselytizing.

Promoting, supporting, and recruiting for groups that oppose our goals will also result in a ban.

###Rule 3: We stay on-topic.

This is a support community.

Posts must seek emotional support for matters directly related to OP and expressed in a way for people to provide it. Any matter OP cannot easily tell or get support from people they personally know is allowed.

Posts should be entirely self-contained text and contain no links.

All comments must constructively support OP. Do not give advice on posts flaired No Advice Wanted (NAW).

If a megathread exists, all related posts should be placed there.

###Rule 4: We reject harmful behaviors.

No personal information.

No harassment. We do not mention non-public people, fellow users, or other subreddits.

###Rule 5: We cooperate to build this community.

Moderators err on the side of safety. For all concerns about the community moderators will discuss it privately in modmail.

Being uncooperative is a distraction for OP and will be remediated in modmail.

#Medical Questions

This is not the place to ask medical questions. Do not ask for a diagnosis or treatment for yourself or anyone else.

You can find mental healthcare providers on websites like [this one](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists), by calling your health insurance company, or by contacting a mental health clinic or hospital in your area.

Our wiki has more in-depth information on the diagnosis process. Including how to find a doctor, what to expect from the appointment, and how to prepare. [Click here to get started.](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergirls/wiki/steps)

Act as a friend, not an as a doctor.  Even when someone has good intentions, armchair doctoring can still be unsafe.

Vulnerability leads to connection!,False,1478502889.0,public,3hflw,False,,"**Radically Open Dialectical Behavioral Therapy** (RO DBT) is a relatively new evidence-based treatment model targeting a spectrum of disorders characterized by excessive self control, or overcontrol (OC) disorders (restrictive eating disorders, autism spectrum disorders, OCD, OCPD), as well as some forms of chronic depression and treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. RO DBT is supported by over 20 years of clinical experience and translational research.

*RO DBT invites us to look at stress as a challenge rather than a threat.* That is, problems are opportunities for growth, self-inquiry, and self-discovery rather than obstacles that block personal wellbeing.

*RO DBT invites us to move toward our discomfort in order to learn.*

**RO DBT defines psychological wellbeing as** involving the confluence of three factors: *receptivity*, *flexibility*, and *social connectedness.*

* *Receptivity* and openness to new experiences and disconfirming feedback in order to learn

* *Flexibility* in adapting to changing environmental conditions

* *Social connectedness* – with at least one other person – based on idea that survival of our species required the capacity to form long-lasting bonds and the ability to work in groups or tribes/communities

​ 
**Overcontrol is characterized by five behavioral themes** that are being targeted by the skills we learn in RO-DBT.
​

* *Inhibited and disingenuous emotional expression:* A mismatch between outward expression and inner experience; shutting down; social avoidance

* *Hyper-detail-focused and overly cautious behavior:* Perfectionism; excessive attention to detail, accuracy, and cleanliness; risk-aversion; ruminative deliberation

* *Rigid and rule-governed behavior:* Excessive attention to proper conduct; dogmatism and inflexibility to new ideas; inability to change plans even when new information is presented to you

* *Aloof and distant style of relating:* Constricted and unemotional displays; detached coldness toward others

* *High social comparisons, envy, and/or bitterness:* Excessive worry about one’s position in their tribe",/r/RadicallyOpenDBT/,1478502889.0,r/RadicallyOpenDBT/

NOTE: While there may be nothing inherently 'wrong' about an individual choosing to end their life, and the creator/moderator(s) of this subReddit are not taking a position against an individual's right to die; because the personal issues involved are often very complex; and because it is believed that the majority of suicidal people would much prefer to improve their lives and continue living if that were possible; and because many people who were once extremely suicidal have gone on to live happy, healthy, productive lives; the goal of this subReddit is to do everything possible to encourage people to stay alive and to promote all methods of suicide prevention that may help suicidal people overcome their struggles, rebuild their lives, and ultimately find the peace, happiness and fulfillment that all of us as humans long for.

Welcome to /r/autistic. For discussion, teaching, engaging exchanges, self-advocacy, advice and support, and for those whose curiosity has carried them to different shores.

--

**Rules**:

* Remember [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)
* Absolutely no sympathy for supremacist ideology which forces a narrative (Autistic or NT) e.g., able-ism.  
* No libel, no concern trolling and no flaming. Don't promote destructive behaviors in yourself and others.
* Keep it PG13. Talk on sex, alcohol and drugs is not prohibited, but avoid explicit detail.

* Strict rule: No pity parties. Asking for advice is encouraged. Sympathy threads and sharing experiences are encouraged. Blaming Autism for life failure is not. It creates the conditions for toxic arguments and self-loathing.

A slip is OK, but repeat offenders and those baiting people into breaking the rules will be dealt with judiciously.

This is first and foremost a forum of intellectual exchange for mutual benefit.

NOTE: While there may be nothing inherently 'wrong' about an individual choosing to end their life, and the creator/moderator(s) of this subreddit are not taking a position against an individual's right to die; because the personal issues involved are often very complex; and because it is believed that the majority of suicidal people would much prefer to improve their lives and continue living if that were possible; and because many people who were once extremely suicidal have gone on to live happy, healthy, productive lives; the goal of this subreddit is to do everything possible to encourage people to stay alive and to promote all methods of suicide prevention that may help suicidal people overcome their struggles, rebuild their lives, and ultimately find the peace, happiness and fulfillment that all of us as humans long for.

#### [](#h4-green)

>This subreddit is by and for people who are Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities (GSRM), including but by no means limited to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) people, and respect for our diversity and experiences is paramount. All are welcome to participate who agree to follow the rules outlined below:

-------------


# Rules

---

>###1: Be respectful   
No GSRM-Phobic content (i.e: homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, aphobia, as well as racism, serophobia, ableism, or sexism) If you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please precede your post's title with [TW]. For example: ""[TW] Title of Post"". Do not try to start an argument for the sake of an argument. Do not make personal attacks.

---

>###2: Must have willingness to learn; no 'you're too sensitive'   
Demonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a safe space. Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim a pejorative so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes about them, or that they otherwise just ""shouldn't be so sensitive."" For lightly moderated LGBT-related discussion, we recommend /r/ainbow. 

---

>###3: No bait-and-switch posts   
Bait and switch type threads, where the title makes them look like a bigot but the body is supportive, are not allowed on r/lgbt. LGBTQ+ people see enough hate in our lives, without 'Gotcha' bait posts.

---

>###4: No advertisements, spam, or crowdfunders   
r/lgbt is here for LGBTQ+ people, their lives, their stories, their content. It is not here for advertising or spam. This includes the advertising of crowdfunders, we cannot verify them, so for safety, we do not allow them.

---

>###5: No survey and research requests   
We are unable to accommodate Survey and Research requests, posts that fall into this category shall be removed. Repeat posters will be banned. We suggest you post these requests to /r/lgbtstudies.

---

>###6: No promoting hate   
Having posted to subreddits with a negative reputation is not necessarily grounds for an automatic ban, but users whose posting history contains bigotry will be met with intense scrutiny.

---

>###7: Don't share hate speech    
r/lgbt is a safe space, and while we want everyone to be able to seek support and advice, sharing hate speech in any way can cause harm to the community.

---

>###8: Don't direct message individual mods about a moderation issue--use modmail!   
Please send [a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flgbt) to r/lgbt rather than DMing individual moderators. This will allow the whole team to know what is going on so the correct moderator can deal with the issue.

---

>###9: NSFW Content.   
r/lgbt is meant to be safe for users of all ages. Do not submit content that a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in public or at the workplace. This includes pornography, sexualized content, graphic violence, or similar. Discussions of sexual topics, including sexual health, are permitted but must be tagged NSFW.

---

>###10: Provide sources when sharing news
We require any post sharing news/social media reactions to news articles to include a link to the original article or announcement in the post body.

---

>###11: No posts asking to rate, roast, or make assumptions about you or your identity.
These posts encourage stereotyping or making assumptions about people based on presentation. Often these can make people uncomfortable and bring out a mix of stereotypes and pressure to present a specific way. This rule includes, but is not limiting to; asking whether or not you pass, asking people to guess your gender/sexuality, and asking people to make assumptions about you based on your appearance.

---

>###12: Moderator Discretion.
Unfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover, in those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we think could potentially cause harm or does not fit within the spirit of the community and the safe space we maintain here, even if it do not fit one of the rules perfectly.

>###13: Use Content Warning flair for upsetting posts.
If you think community members might be upset by the content you are sharing, use the content warning flair, adding a short description. The post will be automatically marked as a spoiler, but please check our rules on NSFW content and sharing hate.

We have just established a new rule about research and survey requests. Please message the mods first if you have a research or survey request for participants, and we will let you know if we think it is appropriate to post here. We do not allow surveys aimed solely at parents and caregivers of autistic people, as this subreddit is aimed at autistic people ourselves (and those questioning if they themselves are autistic), not our neurotypical family members and caregivers. 

We also use identity-first language (""autistic people"" not ""people with autism"") as identity-first language is generally the preference of the autistic self-advocate community.

[**RULES OF THE ROAST:** (click for details)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/about/rules/)

**Roastees:**

 * You must provide at least one high-quality picture of the roastee holding a handwritten sign with the text /r/RoastMe - Phones and Snapchat text overlay is **NOT** allowed! Your hand and at least an implication of a complete arm must be visible.

* Posts may contain multiple images, either natively through Reddit's multi-image feature or hosted on Imgur. All images in an album post must *only* contain the roastee(s), and the first image *must* have a sign (e.g. old pictures of you the roastee as a young child are allowed so long as a current picture of them with a sign is present).

 * All individuals in the picture must be holding the r/RoastMe sign or indicate they are aware of the sign in some way (e.g. by pointing to it). Photos with non-Roastees in the background will be removed if their faces are visible.

 * Photoshopped/edited posts are **NOT** allowed. This **includes** Snapchat filters such as the digitally-added flowers or dog ears. Posting multiple edited photos will result in a ban.

 * Your post will not appear until after it has been approved by a moderator. Please send [this message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/roastme&subject=Post Not Approved&message=Hello, I don't believe my post has been approved yet. Could you please approve my post? Add link to post here: (Make sure you link to the reddit post, not the imgur!\)) if it takes longer than 1 hour.

 * The minimum posting age is **18** years old, your post will be rejected if you look younger or if context clues lead us to conclude you are younger.

 * By submitting a Roast, you agree to your picture being saved, hosted on Imgur, and reposted to Reddit for the purpose of inclusion on ""Best Of"" and ""Highlights"" albums.

 * Your face must be at least 60% visible in the photo.

 * You may post on behalf of other people, provided that the post follows all of the other rules listed above, and it is clear that the person being posted consents to the roast.

 * No joke roasts. Anyone posting a dog, or a ham, or Anne Frank, or Donald Trump, or anything like that will be banned for 3 days. It's not funny.

 * No sexualized content. There are plenty of humiliation fetish subreddits for you, and we aren't one of them.


 * No ads. No onlyfans

**Roasters:**

 * This is a comedy subreddit, not a hate subreddit. Act as though you are trying to make an audience laugh. Please familiarize yourself with all rules before participating.

* This is also not /r/ToastMe. You are here to roast, not flatter. 

 * You *are* allowed to look through the roastee's post history. Do ***not*** roast a roastee anywhere outside of this subreddit. Any such outside harassment is not sanctioned by /r/RoastMe, and will result in a ban upon discovery.

 * Never post another user's personal information, referred to as 'doxxing'. We will always report violations to the admins.

 * Never use suicide, homicide, assault, racism, or pedophilia as the crux of a roast. These subjects are never funny.

 * Please don't use link shorteners in comments (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)

   **3 rule violations and you may face a ban**


If you see something that breaks the rules, please report them or send us a modmail.

**About downvotes:**

In order to protect minority opinions, comment downvotes have been disabled via CSS. Without accountability, redditquette guidelines mean nothing and will only result in a combination of unconscious groupthink (the human mind naturally will try to agree with the majority opinion of the social group he identifies with) and de facto censorship (downvotes *literally* hide comments from view).  Combined, this will lead to a cycle where only the opinions held by the majority will considered without bias.

For this reason, downvotes have been eliminated.

#Rules
=============
1. This is a peer support community. Be a supportive peer. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/subrules_revised#wiki_be_a_supportive_peer).

2. Don't ask for a diagnosis - and don't try to diagnose others. Even if someone were a trauma-trained doctor/psychiatrist, they wouldn't be able to diagnose over the Internet. Seek out professional help instead.  

3. Racism, bigotry, misogyny/misandry, diagnosis discrimination, and other hate speech is unacceptable. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/subrules_revised#wiki_hate_speech).

4. Please be mindful about triggering content. Avoid graphic thread titles, and use [Trigger Warning], NSFW and/or the spoiler tag whenever appropriate.

5. We do not allow RaisedByNarcissists lingo. Please avoid use of abbreviations such as “NMom”, “EBrother”, GC/SG, FLEAs, etc, and avoid casual armchair diagnosis of people who have not been professionally diagnosed. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/subrules_revised#wiki_rbn_lingo).

**Subreddit rules**

1.
Engage in good faith

This sub is for info sharing, healthy discussion and debate - which requires all users to engage in good faith.

This includes considering other points of view, refraining from single-issue contributions (e.g. exclusively pro- or anti-lockdown content), and not misrepresenting evidence to suit an agenda.

Mods will consider recent post history rather than any one post, which may be from this or other subs. If a user engages in bad faith, offending posts will be removed and they may be banned.

2.
Be civil

We do not tolerate incivility, sexism, racism, xenophobia or any form of bigotry. Breaking this rule will result in removal of the post or message and may result in a potential ban.

3.
No NSFW/NSFL content

It is important that information is available to everyone, consequently this sub needs to be suitable for work at all times. Breaking this rule will result in removal of the post or message and may result in a potential ban.

4.
Reliable sources should be used at all times for news and informational content

A reliable source is necessary to ensure that the spread of information remains factual. Breaking this rule will result in removal of the post or message and may result in a potential ban.

5.
No conspiracy theories or fear mongering

No, we are not paid by the CCP, 5G is not causing COVID-19, vaccines do not cause autism. Stop it.
Breaking this rule will result in removal of the post or message and may result in a potential ban.

6.
No misinformation to be posted

While this links to rule 5, it's important enough to be a stand alone rule. Do not misinform anyone, be sure that what you post is factual. Breaking this rule will result in removal of the post or message and may result in a potential ban.

7.
Keep content relevant

Please keep content relevant to the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK. International news should only be posted in exceptional circumstances if it has a particular impact on the UK, for instance the emergence of a new variant. Breaking this rule will result in removal of the post or message and may result in a potential ban.

8.
No repeat posts

Please use the search function to check if a story has already been posted. We get it, you want to be first, but you've probably been beaten to it.

9.
Don't editorialise titles

Submission titles should use the headline or subheading of the article being submitted, and should be changed only where it improves clarity or is absolutely necessary. 

10.
No self-promotion

This is not the place to link to your blog, your new book, your website, your latest YouTube video or podcast. All posts and comments breaking this rule will be removed and persistence may lead to a ban.

11.
No Memes and other low quality content

To keep content of as high a quality as we can and having listened to sub users, we have banned the posting of memes. Other low quality content will also apply. All content of this nature will be deleted. Breaking this rule will result in removal of the post or message and may result in a potential ban.

12.
No trolling or flamebait

Commenting with the intent of provoking anger or argument will result in comment removal and/or a ban.

13.
Use megathread where appropriate

At times there may be a megathread to consolidate discussion on a given topic (e.g. breaking news). Where a megathread is available please use it rather than creating individual posts.

If you have any questions or feedback regarding the moderation of the sub, please messages the moderators.",/r/CoronavirusUK/,1581401807.0,r/CoronavirusUK/

This subreddit was inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/) thread and more specifically, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/c880cv5?context=3) comment.

#RULES:

# Rule 1: Top level comments must contain a genuine attempt at an answer

All direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Accounts using AI to generate answers will be banned. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed.

Please do not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should ""google it."" Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself. Users are coming to NSQ for straightforward, simple answers or because of the nuance that engaging in conversation supplies. LMGTFY links will be removed.

No responses being rude to the questioner for not knowing the answer. 

Exceptions: 

- On-topic follow up questions are allowed. 

- Link only answers permitted if the question happens to be ""What is a good subreddit for...?""

#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question

Try to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).

#Rule 3: Follow reddiquette 

Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.

Check out the [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) page for more info - violations of any of those of clauses may result in a ban without warning. 

#Rule 4: No medical advice questions

No medical advice questions

#Rule 5: No trolling or joke questions

Disallowed: questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, just song lyrics as title, etc.

#Rule 6: No suicide or 'was I raped/sexual assaulted/sexually harrassed?' questions

Suicide related questions are best handled by the resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.

Questions along the lines of ""was I raped?"" or ""was I sexually assaulted?"" are best addressed by the trained, professional support resources you can find here or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/wiki/help).

#Rule 7: No self-promotion, shilling or begging

No trying to draw traffic to product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question.

Asking for upvotes, birthday wishes, handouts, or fundraising support fall under this as well. Please see more appropriate subreddits for that.

#Rule 8: No illegal/unethical or disturbing subject matter

Nothing like ""Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?"" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.

Tasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.

#Rule 9: No disguised rants, agenda posts or potstirring

Other questions not asked in good faith - such as putting a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question. Any questions we suspect of being leading questions or asked merely to promote an agenda or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) will be removed.",/r/NoStupidQuestions/,1359795144.0,r/NoStupidQuestions/

Loose rules, freedom of speech, what is there for an outcast not to like?",False,1428311384.0,restricted,37pgn,False,Back to the front page!,"**Welcome to the INTP and Aspergers Bridge!**

This is a subreddit dedicated for talk between INTPs and those with Aspergers.



INTP is a personality type defined by MBTI, which is described as a logical, rational and non-planning person who is quiet unless disturbed and introverted.

Asperger's syndrome is a mental state where affected people can be shy, ""attached"" towards a particular subject and may have problems with socialising with mainstream people.

Both can have a lack of empathy, and from what I (/u/TheMatrixShibe) have seen, the two groups can socialise seamlessly.

As you can tell, the two can be very similar.

## RULES

Oh boy, not the rules!

1. No unjustified hate speech.

2. No profund or offensive language.

3. Try to be unbiased and tolerant during a discussion involving personal topics.

4. Be yourself and try to follow the rules. It should only be hard if you make it so.",/r/INTPAspBridge/,1428311384.0,r/INTPAspBridge/

#####Welcome to r/Futurology

A subreddit devoted to the field of Future(s) Studies and evidence-based speculation about the development of humanity, technology, and civilization.

#####Posting Rules

>
1. Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.
2. Submissions must be *future focused*. All posts must have an initial comment, a **Submission Statement**, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future.
3. No memes, reaction gifs or similarly low effort content. Images/gifs require a starter comment.
4. No spamming - this includes polls and surveys. This also includes promoting any content in which you have any kind of financial or non-financial stake.
5. Bots require moderator permission to operate
6. Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length. Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence are a distraction to discussion of futurology and may be removed.
7. Account age: >1 day to comment, >5 days to submit content
8. Submissions and comments of accounts whose combined karma is too far in the negatives will be removed
9. Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.

11. Titles must accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission
12. Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content
13. Content older than 6 months must have [month, year] in the title

#####On Futurology

If history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called ""future(s)"" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). 

One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.

**2) Be positive and supportive**  
This is a support space. Comments which are rude, offensive, harsh, unnecessarily critical, impolite, or trolling will be removed.

**3) Posts must focus on Life Pro Tips (whether sharing advice, seeking it, or celebrating LPT victories)**

**4) Adhere to site-wide rules**

This sub acknowledges that some people feel that the term ""neurodivergent"" is problematic and can be used for purposes of erasure.

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.*


## RULES:
**1. NO METAGAMING**

**2. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE**

**3. POSTS MUST BE MEMES OF THE STAR WARS PREQUELS.**

**4. POSTS INAPPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING IN PUBLIC, LIKE AT WORK, MUST BE TAGGED NSFW.**

**5. NO POLITICS.**

**6. NO EDGY OR INFLAMMATORY POSTS.**

**7. NO BRIGADING/ENCOURAGING BRIGADING.**

**8. NO ENCOURAGING SUBREDDIT DRAMA.**

**9. NO ANNOYING BOTS OR NOVELTY ACCOUNTS**

**10. NO SHORT-TERM REPOSTS**

**11. NO LOW-EFFORT POSTS**

**12. NO PROMOTION**

**13. NO MISINFORMATION**

**14. NO SPAM**

##DETAILS:

1. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.

2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who “started it” when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.

3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. ""Prequel"" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. ""Just a picture of Obi-Wan"") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made from prequel-content or about prequel content.

4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn’t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.

5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.

6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.

7. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.

8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start “meme wars”, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit’s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.

9. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.

10. Here are the requirements for reposts:

Posts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them

It also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted

All reposts must be flaired to indicate as such

OP must provide the source of the original in the comments

11. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don’t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn’t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the “I love democracy” macro slapped below it.

12. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although there are exceptions

13. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.

14. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.",/r/PrequelMemes/,1482807947.0,r/PrequelMemes/

This is a support group for individuals who relentlessly take care of their mental well-being and manage to live a healthy, successful lifestyle. Having a mental illness is a constant battle, and being around other people who have figured out how to get by is instrumental in our continued success. Here are some guidelines for posting:


1. Share your success story. When were you diagnosed? What was your low point? What keeps you motivated to stay well? What good things do you have going on in your life now?


2. How are things going? Check in and share what has been going well lately. If you are facing challenges, what strategies are you using to cope? Successful treatment doesn't mean you will be symptom free 100% of the time.


3. Ask for / offer advice. Do you wonder how other people cope with certain problems? Are you proud of yourself for how you handled a certain situation? Mental illness LPT's and LPTR's are encouraged!


4. Please do not post if you are having a breakdown. Think carefully, if your problem can be solved with the advice: ""Talk to your doctor/therapist"", ""Continue taking your medication"", ""Make sure you're getting enough sleep"" or ""cut back on drugs/alcohol"", please visit one of the other fine mental illness subs, they are a great resource.


5. Share stories of celebrities or other people with mental illnesses that have affected your life in a positive way.


6. If you would like to do so, add flare to display what illness you were diagnosed with so other users can reach out. Please stick to illnesses recognized in the DSM V. Keep your flare simple.


7. Feel free to post a question if you do not have a mental illness and are curious about something. If you think you might have a mental illness and haven't been diagnosed, no one here can diagnose you (this falls under ""Talk to your doctor/therapist"").

#Rules
###Post titles must be clear and informative
* Book request titles must contain details about the kind of book you’re looking for and/or keywords that will inform future searches.
* Reviews and screenshots of book excerpts must contain the book title/author in the post title.  Gush and critique posts should contain the book title/author if applicable.
* Inflammatory titles like Does Anyone Else, Unpopular Opinion, or similar are not allowed
* Book request titles must contain details about the kind of book you’re looking for
* “What was that book called” posts are exempt from this rule, as they are unlikely to show up in future searches

###Book requests must be specific and contain detail
* Book requests must be specific and request something that cannot be found with a simple search of the sub.   Low-effort book requests will be removed.  An acceptable book request includes **at least one** of the following:
* Details beyond just a trope, like a specific occupation or uncommon type of scene
* Relevant info as to why you want to read the type of book requested
* Other uncommon books/authors you've enjoyed
* Polls asking which book to read next are not permitted.
* When requesting books, please be considerate and stay engaged in your post to reply/thank those who make suggestions. Users who make frequent book requests should meaningfully interact with the sub in other ways (suggest books for others, comment on discussions, etc.)


###No Self-Promotion, writing research, or surveys
* This sub is focused exclusively on readers. The only permissible place for authors to mention their book, discuss romance writing, ask for help with it, or do research about romance books is in the [Self-Promotion Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/xuj5if/promote_your_books_fall_2022_selfpromotion_thread/)
* Self-promo user flair is not allowed.
* Surveys are not permitted.





###No Memes or Tik Toks

* Funny memes and TikToks are ONLY allowed in the [Meme Monday Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Meme%22&restrict_sr=1&sort=new) which are posted every Monday, or in the comments section of a post.
* Videos or media supplemental to a request or other post should be linked in the text of the post to prevent autoplay.


###Mark spoilers, stay on topic and warn about books with no HEA

* Plot spoilers should be marked with spoiler tags.
* The [definition](https://www.rwa.org/Online/Romance_Genre/About_Romance_Genre.aspx#The_Basics) of a romance novel is a love story that ends in a happily ever after (HEA) or happy for now (HFN). All books mentioned here must meet this criteria unless noted otherwise.
* Non-HEA romantic fiction may be discussed here, but you MUST warn users that there is not a happy ending for the relationship.
* Fanfiction and YA may be recommended here, but must be clearly noted.  Requests for specific fanfiction or YA are not allowed.

###Be Kind & No Book Shaming

* Your responses to others on the sub should be kind and respectful - remember the human, per Reddit’s content policy. It’s fine to disagree with someone, but your comment should be constructive and purposeful.

* No book shaming. It’s fine to state your opinion on a book, author, or subgenre, but you may not insult or shame people who like it. Please be respectful of others' tastes in romance with regard to steam level, tropes, or favorite authors.

* We value this subreddit’s overall positive, supportive and fun community, and want to keep it that way.


###No Piracy

* Do not reference how to access or request creative work that has not been authorized by the rights holder, including but not limited to YouTube videos of audiobooks/movies, PDFs of books,  etc.

* Any external link to original content must either be on the creator’s own site or properly attributed.
* AI-created content such as ChatGPT, and AI-generated fanart are prohibited as they promote pirated content. Published AI book covers are allowed.

* Fair use of copyrighted material is allowed.




###No discrimination, bigotry, or microaggressions towards marginalized groups

* Racism, anti-queer bigotry, and any other discrimination are prohibited here, along with microaggressions like invalidation, denial or derailment.

###No sexual content involving minors

* Per Reddit’s content policy, books recommended here should not contain explicit sexual content involving minors. RomanceBooks does not allow book requests, recommendations, or discussion topics on incest, pedophilia, or child sexual exploitation. Posts and comments promoting such books will be removed.

###Mod Attention Please

* Use this option to report a comment or post that you think might break rules but you're not sure which one, or if there's an escalating conversation you'd like to call the mod team's attention to.

Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.

This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.

After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq).

#**Rules**

##1. Be Civil

Attack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.

This rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).

Be respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.

##2. Voting Rules

Upvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. **DON'T** downvote if you think OP is an asshole. **DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH.** Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. 

Don't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. **Brigading will earn a permanent ban.**

##3. Accept Your Judgment

This sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.

##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion

DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for **at least 48 hours**. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.

##5. No Violence

Don't even *mention* violence.

If your post or comment references violence, don't share it here. Any hint, mention, euphemism or suggestion of violence falls under this rule and isn't allowed.

Comments and even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited. **Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.**

##6. How To Post

The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.

Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.

##7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts

Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be ""the asshole.""

Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.

##8. No Shitposts

Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written by you, from your point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.

This is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, or creative writing exercises.

Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.

##9. Do Not Ask For Advice

This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.

You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.

If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.

##10. Updates and META posts are restricted

Posts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.

Update posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the [update criteria](https://tinyurl.com/zn2kbnnw) for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.
 
This is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.

##11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts

We do not allow posts where the central conflict is about familial or platonic partings, relationships, and/or reproductive autonomy.

The following posts are forever banned:

AITA for breaking up with/ghosting/cutting contact with _ (or not)

AITA for dating _ (or not)

AITA for doing sexual act _ (or not)

AITA for being attracted to _ (or not)

Any reproductive autonomy decision

Any posts related to cheating- including ""telling on"" someone for cheating (or not).

And similar.

##12. This Is Not A Debate Sub

If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.

No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups

##13. No Revenge Stories

There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.

##14. No Medical Conflicts

AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.

From Wikipedia, ""*Neurodiversity refers to variations in the human brain regarding sociability, learning, attention, mood, and other mental functions*"". It is essentially a rebranding of the term ""mentally ill"" or ""mentally dysfunctional"" to eliminate the stigma of these disorders and to view them not as defects but as variations in human behavior and sense of self. This includes, but is not limited to, Aspergers/ASD, ADHD, BPD, OCD, etc.

**What is Marxism?** 

From Wikipedia, ""*Marxism is a theory and method of working-class self-emancipation. As a theory, it relies on a method of socioeconomic analysis that views class relations and social conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and takes a dialectical view of social transformation*"". Marxism is a growing/changing economic/sociopolitical worldview and method of socioeconomic inquiry based upon a materialist interpretation of historical development, a dialectical view of social change, and an analysis of class-relations within society and their application in the analysis and critique of the development of capitalism. Marxism encompasses an economic theory, a sociological theory, a philosophical method and a revolutionary view of social change.

**How does Marxism and Neurodiversity Relate?**

Neurodiverse individuals are often treated as barriers to economic growth and progress by capitalists for their behaviors interrupting the flow of workplace productivity. Neurodiverse individuals cannot function the same as their neurotypical peers, and therefor cannot perform the same labor or with the same efficiency as the bourgeoisie would want. Capitalists attempt to remedy these ""dysfunctions"" through the application of medication or treatment to ""normalize"" these individuals and make them more fit for the capitalist workforce. Neurodiverse Marxists view this as a violation of ND folk's autonomy and freedom of expression, and is only an attempt to erase the existence of these groups to no longer hinder capitalist growth and exploitation. Within a Marxist society, ND individuals would not have to alter themselves for workplace efficiency, and would have the time and means of probing their true interests and hobbies without an income to feel fulfilled or happy.

*""For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic""* - Karl Marx",/r/ndmarxism/,1559663905.0,r/ndmarxism/

> **Posting Rules**
---
 ---
*Remember: the rules change on weekends! See 'The /r/trees Weekend' below.*
 ---
1. **No Black Market Sourcing:** Do not offer, or ask for, recommendations on: where or how, on the black market, to acquire cannabis or anything derived from it (extracts, edibles, seeds, THC, CBD, etc.) freely exchanged or otherwise; or on how to smuggle, transport, ship, mail, or otherwise travel with cannabis or its derivatives. Do not make any posts involving meetups or other location-specific topics.
2. **No personal attacks:** Be respectful to fellow posters – name-calling, rudeness, slurs, vulgarities towards other users, and trolling are not welcome here.
3. **No minors:** /r/trees is strictly 18+ only, no exceptions (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq#wiki_why_is_.2Fr.2Ftrees_18.2B.3F) for more information on why). You might be interested in /r/saplings instead, where Redditors under 18 can ask questions about cannabis and its effects.
4. **No advertising:** All forms of advertising and self-promotion are strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, posts promoting specific products or name brands, promoting YouTube channels or other forms of Social Media, and linking to online stores or other places designed to make money. Learn more about self-promotion on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).   Learn more about [spam](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-spam-am-i-spammer) on Reddit.
5. **No low-quality link posts outside of Saturday:** This includes memes, image macros, screenshots, simple trees references (such as pineapples and “420”), posts  about broken glassware and spilled bowls, and all posts not directly about cannabis (besides the title). Those are allowed on “Slack-Post Saturday” every week, but you can make all those posts at /r/see during the week instead. See the [visual posting guide](http://imgur.com/a/1WL7J) showing types of disallowed posts.
6. **No NSFW/Porn:** Do not post nudity or any sort of explicit porn. 
7. **No reposts:** For links, this involves any picture posted in the previous 6 months. For text posts, this involves asking any commonly asked questions on /r/trees (including questions about drug testing). For those, use the search bar and our [FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq).
8. **No posts that harm the community:** Do not post pictures of tagging/vandalism, encourage driving while high (including pictures where you are obviously driving while high), post about sneaking weed past TSA, or make other posts harmful to the trees community.
9. **No posts promoting political candidates:** Posts that endorse a political candidate, regardless of the connection to cannabis, are disallowed.  
10. **No posts involving a personal loss:** Those should be kept to the ""Monday Mourning"" thread each week.

The /r/trees mod team reserves the right to remove any other posts at our discretion. You can [contact the mod team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftrees) with any questions.

---
#### [](#h4-green)  
> **The /r/Trees Weekend**
---
 ---
####SLACK-POST SATURDAY
 ---
* Every **Saturday**, *we relax our rules*. Artwork, GIFs, and image macros are all permitted for the day.
* Not everything goes though: you still **can't** upload NSFW, ask for hookups/meetups, show disrespect towards other users or advertise anything *at all*. Read more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2hhh5t/introducing_slack_post_saturday_bringing_back/).
> 
---
####SELF-POST SUNDAY
 ---
* Every **Sunday**, *you can submit text posts only.*
* This allows for a break from all of the link posts during the week, so the community can share their stories and talk with each other. Naturally, we are less strict regarding the removal of text posts.

####[NORMAL THEME](http://www.reddit.com//r/unpopularopinion)
***

##**How This Place Works**
* **Upvote:** Opinions that you Disagree with.    
* **Downvote:** Opinions that you Agree with.

##**Banned topics** 
* **Porn, Fat/Skinny/Body Weight, Pedophilia or Related topics, Posts about Sexual Assault, Nazi and related content, [Banned Topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/wiki/index/)**
    

##**Rules** 
* **If you see a post that breaks one or more of these rules, please report it so the moderators can take action.**  

Rule 1: **Your post must be an unpopular opinion.**

* Your post must be an opinion. Not a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. An opinion. One opinion. A subjective statement about your position on some topic. Please have a clear, self contained opinion as your post title, and use the text field to elaborate and expand on why you think/feel this way.

* Your opinion must be unpopular. Unpopularity is a bit like an onion. It has layers. Be specific as to where you believe your opinion is unpopular.

Rule 2: **Do not post low effort/satirical/troll posts.**

* We get it, you all think this sub is garbage and is just for popular opinions, and you want to be funny and post ""going to be downvoted to oblivion here, but I think racism is bad."" We enjoy the memes, but please keep them off the sub.

* If your post is just one sentence it will be removed. Please try and elaborate on your opinion and justify your position.

* Any opinion that is not well thought out, incoherent, internally contradictory or otherwise nonsensical is subject to removal.

Rule 3: **Do not post opinions that are heavily posted/have been on the front page recently.**

* Recent reposts are not allowed.

* Opinions that are constantly posted here are not allowed.

* Posts relating to highly popular topics aren't allowed outside of the relevant megathreads. You can find a list of the topics and their respective megathreads in a post on the top of the sub.

* POSTS DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS SUBREDDIT ARE NOT ALLOWED. No, this isn't censoring criticism, they're just overposted. If you have a meta opinion, put it in the megathread.

* We ask that if a post fails to post do not just spam repost it; message mod mail.

Rule 4: **Be Civil.**

* This applies for both your behaviour on the sub, and the opinions which you post.

* Obey the sitewide rules and [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette).

* No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or general bigotry.

* Some opinions are so inappropriate/offensive that they'll be removed as hate posts. These posts are usually, but not exclusively, those that target a particular sex, race, sexual orientation, etc, when the user in question is hostile, vulgar or aggressive towards said group.

Rule 5: **No Political Posts.**

* Our users have voted for no political posts in this sub, and this rule will not be changed until the majority votes otherwise. 

* It's very unlikely your political post is an unpopular opinion. Feel free to use the Politics Megathread pinned to the front page. Our civility rules apply at all times.",/r/unpopularopinion/,1329182830.0,r/unpopularopinion/

#Rules/Guidelines:
for the nuances of these rules, please read the [expanded ruleset](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules)

###Remember - all judgment is left at moderator discretion.

* Do not post, link to, or ask for personal information
* No trolling, hate speech, or using slurs
* Do not insult other users, flamewar, or flame bait
* Do not /u/ summon users from linked threads
* Do not vote or comment in linked threads

###When in doubt about a rule, please read the rules wiki, or message us for clarification.

Users who break rules may receive a warning via PM or a distinguished comment. You may be warned for rule offenses instead of banned, but certain offenses are ban-on-sight, and **all bans are up to the mod's discretion.**

#Linking

The golden rule of submitting drama is: **Don't bore us.**

If a post doesn't fit these rules, if it's entertaining as fuck submit it anyway and we'll look at it to make an exception. If you're not sure, you can always contact us via modmail.


* **Avoid bias and do not submit drama you are directly involved in.** Remain as neutral as possible; biased titles/self posts are grounds for deletion.
* **SRD is not a call-out subreddit.** If your post points out bad behavior more than it does drama, it will be removed. 
* **Do not make us hunt for the drama.** When submitting drama do not link to the full comments, to images, or otherwise to outside of a comment thread. Links to full threads are allowed where the drama is obvious, but use common sense and direct links when applicable. Use ?context when appropriate. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules#wiki_submitting_self_posts_and_write-ups) for more information.

#Surplus Popcorn

This is the current list of drama that has a higher bar for submission.

* Partisan pissmatch
* Gun drama
* Gender wars
* Racism drama
* Social Justice drama

If you're going to submit drama for these topics, make sure it's quality! See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules#wiki_surplus_popcorn) for more information.

Estimates suggest [as many as 1 in 50 people](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/174866407X231001) are born with the condition, and others develop it later in life. 

Face blind people often have trouble recognizing acquaintances, friends, family, or themselves, and will often use alternative recognition strategies such as memorizing hairstyle and other distinguishing features. 

This is a casual community for face blind redditors (and their loved ones) to discuss life with face blindness!

---
Do: Post content relating to face blindness - stories, questions, memes, coping strategies

Don't: Be a jerk. No name-calling, and no racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.!

---
####RULES
**Rule 1: Be civil (don't be a jerk)** No name-calling or other forms of harassment will be tolerated! No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.

**Rule 2: No ""Do I have prosopagnosia?"" posts** We're not doctors, and we can't diagnose you! Check out the links on the sidebar for helpful information.

**Rule 3: No promoting pseudoscientific cures/treatments** Although there are strategies and coping mechanisms to help compensate for face blindness, there are no scientifically-backed treatments for face blindness itself. People with prosopagnosia can't store and process faces the way a neurotypical person would, and this can't be fixed by “paying more attention” or “training your brain” into recognizing faces. We welcome discussion around peer-reviewed research, but claims to have a cure/treatment without providing a reputable source will be removed!

**Rule 4: ""Guess Who?"" posts** (""these people look similar"") **are now only allowed on FRIDAY!** If the point of your image is “these people look similar,” please wait until Friday to post it. (We’re all bad with faces. Seeing these posts too often is boring and a little demoralizing.)

**Rule 5: Contact the moderators before submitting a survey / research request** Please tell us who you are and what the goals of your research are!

**Rule 6: Contact the moderators before self-promoting/advertising**

--

####AM I FACE BLIND?

Facial recognition is a spectrum. If you're asking yourself this question, you likely do have some degree of face blindness.

Some common signs include:

* Having trouble recognizing family and friends

* Frequently using non-facial cues to recognize people (voice, hairstyles, distinctive features) and experiencing difficulty if those cues change (getting a haircut, wearing unfamiliar clothing)

* Confusing characters while watching movies/TV

* Not recognizing people ""out of context"" (coworkers, classmates, etc.)

**Rules**

* Be nice. 
* **Provide Info:** When you ask for advice, give as much information as possible (e.g., LSAT/GPA/URM, age, where you want to practice, ties to the area, what kind of law you want to do, total cost of attendance). When posting an admissions decision, please provide as much information as you are comfortable communicating. We **will not** remove a post for not including stats, as we respect people's privacy decisions and encourage everyone to participate. However, please consider the benefit that slightly anonymized stats would provide to the community.
* **On giving advice:** When giving advice, answer the question first. If both options asked about are bad, you can point that out too and explain why.
* **Affirmative action discussion policy:** [See this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/aludrb/re_affirmative_action_stats_and_admission/).

**New Community Members**

Welcome! We hope you are able to benefit from and contribute to our community of law school applicants. In order to cut down on spam and trolling, new members to r/lawschooladmissions and Reddit may have their posts automatically filtered for manual review based on a variety of account factors. If you believe your post was filtered and is still not approved after 24 hours, feel free to send a message to the mods. Thank you!

**Retakes**

Retakes are a no brainer in these circumstances:

* You scored at the low end of your PT average
* Your scores were still increasing in the weeks up to test day
* You had less than perfect on logic games

If none of these are true for you, and you're clearly stalled, then make this clear. Most people posting have retake potential.

Even 2-3 points can make a large difference in admissions/scholarships. That's why so many people here post ""retake!"" to a lot of situations.

**Canada?** Most people here are US. So most advice doesn't apply. Feel free to ask questions, though, there are some Canadians. Big differences:

* Almost no scholarships. 
* Most schools are pretty good.
* Go where you want to practice
* GPA is significantly more important. Do all you can to raise it.
* For god's sake don't go abroad. That's Canada's TTT.",/r/lawschooladmissions/,1375382246.0,r/lawschooladmissions/
193,True,UnboxedNetwork,Influencer marketing 2.0 | Get Paid to Post,r/UnboxedNetwork,582,t5_k6n3v,Unboxed is a blockchain based system that allows businesses to pay you directly for using your influence. This means you get a share of the $36 billion they’re spending per year on FB ads. So for every brand related photo you upload and for every comment you post you can get paid.,False,1528463685.0,restricted,k6n3v,False,,"A Working Business

Unboxed is a fully functioning technology utilized by over 100+ brands globally (spanning the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Norway and the Baltics). Over 40,000 lines of code, hundreds of iterations, and product pivots throughout the year have enabled company to today deliver large scale word-of-mouth campaigns that involve millions of everyday social media users.

A Massive Market

Brands are spending over 36 billion US dollars on social media ads per year. These ads are often times ignored and not trusted by people. Meanwhile, 9 out of 10 people trust content posted by someone they know. That, is where Unboxed comes in. We match-make brands with social media users that create and post authentic brand related content. It enables a lot better engagement, creates real brand advocacy and word-of-mouth effect. It also empowers social media users.

The Perfect Cure

Unboxed offers the perfect cure for companies sick of wasting time and money on influencer marketing companies that rely on labour intensive processes for finding the right influencers, negotiating deals, and managing relationships. These high touch processes limit the number of social media users who can be involved in word-of-mouth campaigns and businesses usually end up working with a small group of social media users - influencers or celebrities. 

Involving everyone

We thought outside the box and came up with a solution that allows us to replace this small pool of influencers with millions of everyday social media users - who we call Unboxers. We also replace campaign managers with marketing experts who can manage thousands of campaigns in a decentralized manner, by combining AI with an independent network of marketing experts. With that, we enable social media users to get their share of the $36bn market.

The Plan

Our business is set to grow from operating in 10 countries at present to working in over 100 markets. To accelerate the process we will build a team of 125 professionals by 2021.",/r/UnboxedNetwork/,1528463685.0,r/UnboxedNetwork/

**INTP** is a personality type within Jungian Cognitive Function theory.

If you used an online test of any sort to determine your personality type, it is recommended that you become educated in Jungian Cognitive Functions.  The following resource is a very all-encompassing outline of the system and describes the difference between the generalizations perpetuated by MBTI and the more systematic approach cognitive functions take in categorizing people in the way they think:

* [Descriptions of Cognitive Functions From Various Sources](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/213-MBTI-Descriptions-of-cognitive-functions-from-various-sources) 

MBTI is akin to horoscope, while Jungian Cognitive Functions (often incorrectly referred to as ""MBTI"") categorizes people according to their intrinsic differences in cognitive attitudes.

of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

**Do not directly insult individuals or groups**

This forum allows open discussion and debate, but please do not make it personal. A good way to avoid problems is to make sure you are presenting your own specific experiences and opinions, not making generalisations about a group.

This rule includes, but is not limited to: negative stereotypes of autistic people; negative stereotypes of disability; transphobia; homophobia; sexism; and racism.

**Do not invalidate the experiences of other people**

Your are free to talk about your own experiences. Please recognise that other people may have different experiences. In particular, please do not suggest that autism, autistic experiences, or difficulties associated with being autistic do not exist.

**Do not perpetuate negative stereotypes**

Please do not label people as autistic because they exhibit negative behaviors, or assume that someone's bad behavior is because they are autistic.

**Respect the language preferences of the people you are talking to**

You won't be banned or censored because you say ""person with autism"" instead of ""autistic people"". We all have different preferences. But please be polite when people tell you how they prefer to be called.

**Do not post pseudoscience or misinformation**

Please be sensible when reporting posts based on this rule. This rule will not be used to stifle debate and discussion on contentious issues, only to filter things like spurious medical or legal claims.

**Include a summary and explanation when posting a link to material elsewhere**

This rule particularly applies when posting the same link to multiple groups, and when you are advertising your own content on a blog or video elsewhere.

**Put research recruitment posts in the sticky research thread**

Researcher posts do not need special permission, so long as they go into the sticky research thread, following the guidance there.

**Non-autistic people are welcome**

You don't have to be autistic to post here. This includes, but is not limited to, people wondering if they are autistic, and dealing with autistic adults in their lives.

As social situations can be tough for those on the autism spectrum, finding Christian community in a church can be difficult. Here, the goal is to create a safe community where fellow believers can share their struggles with faith, life, social situations, and the like.

**Rules**

1. No belittling Christianity

2. Be respectful of other users. There are REAL people on the other end of the screen when you post. 

3. If you want to post a link to /r/aspiechristian on other subs, message the mods there first.

4. Avoid theological/religious debates. Religion is a sensitive issue and it can be easy to get caught up in these debates. We are a community that is here to support one another, first and foremost. There are other great subreddits to discuss and debate theological issues, such as /r/christianity or /r/debatereligion

*The quick and dirty version (or click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines) for the full set):* 

>##**Minimum participation requirements:**
✓ Participants here must participate in good faith.     
✓ Verify your account through Reddit's email verification system.     
✓ Meet a minimum karma requirement.     


>##**About what you post:**
✓ Use the search tool [and FAQ](/r/AskWomen/w/index) before you post.  
✖ No personal advice or posts about your personal situation.  
✖ No seeking medical advice or information.  
✖ No pot-stirring or discussion of other subreddits.  
✖ No agenda questions. This is not your personal soapbox.  
✖ No ""would you rather"" or ""does anyone else"" posts permitted.  
✖ No yes/no questions.    
✖ No gifts or shopping posts about specific brands or stores.  
✖ No surveys or research.


>##**About how you post it:**
✓ Post titles must be a descriptive, in depth question and searchable using keywords, or will be removed. DAE or questions that can be answered with just a yes/no will be removed    
✓ Please use ""spoiler"" formatting where appropriate.  Follow [text you wish to hide] with (/spoiler), (#spoiler), or (/s) to activate. [SPOILER](#spoiler)    
✖ No personal attacks.  
✖ [No gendered slurs.](/r/askwomen/w/genderedslurs)  
✖ No graceless generalizations. Speak only for yourself. Do not generalize based on gender, race, or ethnicity.    
✖ No misogyny, misandry, transphobia, ageism, racism, general assholery, invalidation, or otherwise hateful or disrespectful commentary.  
✖ No derailing. Talk via PM or start a new thread.    
✖ No specifying majority demographics or excluding minority groups based on demographics.     
✖ No questions about genital size, shape, or configuration preferences.



>##**About links:**

✖ No posting personal pictures.    
✖ No linking to other subreddits.  
✖ No linking to specific threads in /r/askwomen in other subreddits.  
✖ No self-promotion.    
✖ No using URL-shortening sites.  

>##[](#icon-exclamation)**Violating any of these rules will result in moderator action.**

##### [](#h5-yellow)
>[](http://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/wiki/rules#wiki_recommendations.3A) 

✓ Please be inclusive with question phrasing. Questions specifying majority demographics are not permitted.    
✖ Downvote only to indicate that either a comment or post does not add to discussion; not to indicate disagreement. AskWomen benefits from honest answers with a variety of perspectives. On that note, saying, ""Be honest,"" is rude and unnecessary.     
✓ Familiarize yourself with [Reddit 101.]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/2by6wm/reddit_101/)    
✓ Use the report button on all comments and posts that violate the rules in the sidebar.     
✓ Add flair!  We have flair for men, women, trans folks, and gender neutral people.     
✓ Be specific: ask a general question, get a general answer.   
✓ This is not a debate sub. Attempts to invalidate or argue someone else's response are not permitted.   
✓ Common topics are determined by how often the topics come up, how likely the answers are to change, and whether it is already a FAQ topic. The timeframe for considering something common or recently asked takes all of that into account.


⚠ **Moderator Discretion:** While the rules of this sub are listed above, no set of rules can cover all of the content that people may post. Unfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover. In those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we find insidious, inflammatory, or that does not fit within the spirit of the community even if the stated rules do not specifically disallow that content.  In short, don't be an asshole

there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

#Subreddit Rules

1.  Be polite and practice mutual respect. Absolutely no personal attacks, insults, or threats. No discrimination.

2. If you criticize, make it constructive criticism.

3.  Speak for yourself and not for others.

4.  Respect individual differences. Among other things, this includes differences of identity, experiences of having or not having gender dysphoria, experiences of transition, and the choice to be out or stealth.

5. No body shaming. This includes personal and general judgments about weight, surgeries, and appearance.

6. No trolling and no reposting of trolling and/or transphobic content. Trolling includes posts or comments meant to elicit controversy or drama.

7. Do not post information or photos of another person without their permission. Exercise caution when sharing personal information - this is a public subreddit.

8. Business advertisements are prohibited. We also are currently not accepting any research requests. Users selling items or relevant need at reasonable prices or users soliciting free/lost cost items may post in our monthly [Buy/Sell/Trade/Giveaway thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/search?q=flair%3Arecurring%20Buy%2FSell%2FTrade%2FGiveaway&restrict_sr=1) Users fundraising may post in our monthly [Fundraiser thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/search?q=flair%3Arecurring%20Fundraiser&restrict_sr=1)

9.  Flair your posts; Do not use the flairs ""ModPost"" or ""Recurring"" as they are reserved. If you edit content in a significant way, specify where you edited it. Follow Reddit's **[content policy.](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/)** Some highlights: mark NSFW items as NSFW, do not post illegal content, do not create a new account to avoid a ban. 

10. Selfies, Selfie-similar pictures, graphical art, random pics of your cat and vocal range images may only be posted in the appropriate dedicated, recurring threads. [Check here for a history list of recurring threads sorted by new.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/search?q=Flair%253Arecurring&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=1)  The only allowed pics are surgery related and product review related. Any in those categories should be well-marked with the relevant details and should not be advertisements in any   way. They are meant to be informative.

Group support and individual support is available.

**Peer counselling practice – how do peers provide counselling?**

""The role of the peer is to provide support.  They have learned to listen without judgement and assist the client to explore their concerns and find their own solutions.   The peer is non-judgemental, and carefully listens to the client.  With the peer’s empathic understanding the client is able to explore fully their concerns and arrive at their own solutions.   The peers initially may wish to “help” and often find it difficult not to offer advice, but they also have learned that by “fixing”, they limit exploration of the problem and the client is less likely to act on the offered solution.   By not “fixing” and offering advice the peers are free to focus on the client’s feelings, emotions and concerns.  Through this process, the client feels heard, accepted, and safe to explore fully the issue at hand.

It is important for agencies that provide services to a community ensure that there will not be harm done by the peers providing counselling.  The NANNIE process as outlined in this manual strives to reduce harm, this is done by not offering advice or “fixes” for problems.""

Counsellors are to use the NANNIE approach:

* No Judgement

* Acceptance

* No Fixing/No advice

* No Questions

* It is not about you

* Empathy

Peer counsellors must also display the following attributes of non-directive counselling, as outlined by [Bill Coleman PhD in his manual for peer counsellors](http://bcoleman.ca/manual-for-peer-counsellor-training/):


   * Focus on the experiencing of self
   * Moment by moment empathy
   * High level of personal presence
   * Egalitarian stance
   * Self-determination and free choice as human possibilities
   * Pro-social nature of human beings
   * The client is the expert
   * The peer accepts the clients knowledge
   * The client is the expert for both the content and process of discussion
   * The peer is a facilitator for the client
   * The peer is wholly present
   * The client comes first (client centred)
   * Counselling is the art of “not knowing” not fixing not having answers….
   *  The non-directive approach sees resources instead of problems
   *  Non directive approach sees the ability to grow instead of disorder
   * The peer listens and is facilitative instead of guiding/steering or giving advice
   *  The peer may provide education but not teach


Please understand that everyone here is on the Autism Spectrum, and we all experience difficulties in our daily lives. Our counsellors are just peers and they are bound to make mistakes as they are only human. We are all here to provide understanding and facilitate communication between individuals on the spectrum. People with ASD know fully well the struggles of social interaction that we all face- it important to be able to speak to people that understand these struggles.

Please refrain from discussing the dangers of using psychedelics because psychedelics have been proven to be far less dangerous than any other type of psychoactive medications.

This is also the place for autistic people to ask for advice about using psychedelics.

This is not the place for buying or selling psychedelics.",False,1525022551.0,restricted,imj8j,False,,"Rules:

1.) This is only about how psychedelics affect people with autism, use another subreddit for general questions about psychedelics or for talking about using other more traditional medications for helping the autistic.

2.) Weed is considered a psychedelic on this forum.

3.) Any drug classified as a hallucinogen, dissociative, or any drugs that have been used in traditional cultures to contact their ancestors (ayahuasca and iboga) are considered psychedelics in this subreddit. 

4.) Drugs that are extremely dangerous such as meth or opioids are off-limits, as are any drugs that cause someone to become physically dependent. 

5.) Datura, while on-limits, should be prefaced psychedelic drugs.

6.) Trip reports from autistic people are welcome.

7.) Answering any questions that autistic people have about using psychedelics or about what to expect during a psychedelic trip is also welcome.

8.) Abelism in any form is not welcome. Any posts or comments suggest that autistic people are less than human or don't have opinions that mater will result in the ban hammer slamming down with a minimum 6-month ban. Since this is not 4-chan, we expect you to respect autistic people. Since this is not middle or high school, we expect you not to bully autistic people. If what you're going to post is not going to make autistic people in this subreddit feel safe and welcome don't post it.

9.) No buying or selling of drugs in this forum. While I personally think that the Drug War should end and people should be allowed to buy or sell whatever they want Reddit doesn't want their service to turn into a black market for drugs. Plus, if you can't figure out how to access the darknet and buy some cryptocurrency without handholding from people on Reddit, psychedelics might not be right for you at this point in your life.

10.) Instructions on how to extract psychedelics from plants are OK  in this subreddit as long as the actual sales of plants are not being conducted. Please warn people about the dangers of extraction methods. I would rather people talk about extractions and learn how to extract chemicals safely than risk their health because of a lack of information how to perform a safe extraction.

11.) Any questions about harm-reduction such as but not limited to the proper dose to use, or where to buy test kits or other harm reduction tools are OK in this subreddit. Message the mods before linking anything for sale so we can tell you if it is OK to post or not if you want to avoid a ban for selling drugs in this subreddit. 

12.) We are tolerant of the autistic and are not ban happy. If you make a mistake and promise not to do the same thing twice, we'll unban you. If you do the same thing a 2nd time, you'll get banned again. We want to make this place autistic-friendly and understand that some autistic people may not understand the rules; we don't want to unjustly ban an autistic person over a mistake, but we also want to make this subreddit a safe place for all. 

If you have any doubts about whether or not a post is OK to make in this subreddit message the mods making the post.

Memes posted here don't necessarily have to be about Asperger's.   Any anime meme is welcome! *(...so long as it conforms with the rules.)*

New to anime? I tried to write an [introduction](https://old.reddit.com/r/AspieAnimemes/wiki/introduction) in the wiki section.

#Rules:

##Must reference anime.

All posts must contain some reference to an anime, to anime in general, to a virtual YouTuber, to an anime community, or to a game with anime style art.

This sub is intended for people with Asperger's, but it is not necessary for all posts to be *about* Asperger's.

Posts that are specifically about Asperger's will however get a bit more leeway with this rule.

*(i.e. If a post references a Japanese non-anime game, or a show that is often mistaken for anime, it will be fine so long as it an aspie meme.)*

If a meme references one of the required topics for this rule, but is also about Asperger's, then it may be eligible for the [hall of fame](https://old.reddit.com/r/AspieAnimemes/wiki/hall_of_fame).

##Be polite.

Rude words aren't allowed here.

This is an Asperger's sub; talking negatively about people with Asperger's with the intention to offend is forbidden, and could result in a ban.

People who think that Asperger's is completely negative, or something that should be ""cured"" are not welcome here.

##Anime music only.

If a video post contains sound, then any music in it must be from an anime.

##NSFW posts and spoilers must be marked as such.

If a post has content that isn't safe for under 18s, then please mark it with the NSFW tag. If your post might make people browsing in public uncomfortable, but doesn't contain any adult content, then use the spoiler tag and write ""NSFS"" (Not safe for school) in the title, enclosed by square brackets.

If your post is a spoiler; use the spoiler tag and write ""Spoiler"" in the title, enclosed by square brackets. If your post isn't NSFS, but is a spoiler, then please mark it as such, but there is no real need to write ""spoiler"" in the title as well.

All posts should contain the name of anime that they reference (Source ^(()^(also known as the Sauce)^) ) in the title. They should also show what episode the meme references/is about, especially if it is a spoiler.

##Use titles sensibly.

Titles must describe the post, or add information. They shouldn't be part of the meme, or irrelevant to the post.

Posts should contain the name of anime that they reference (Source, or sauce) in the title. This is so that people who are interested can easily find out about it, and so that people can see what anime it spoils if it is a spoiler.

Titles shouldn't contain spoilers, as they can be seen without going in to the post.

**The Light Therapy Reddit**

**Light Therapy** - classically referred to as heliotherapy—consists of exposure to daylight or to specific wavelengths of light using polychromatic polarised light, lasers, light-emitting diodes, fluorescent lamps, dichroic lamps or very bright, full-spectrum light. The light is administered for a prescribed amount of time and, in some cases, at a specific time of day.

One common use of the term is associated with the treatment of skin disorders, chiefly psoriasis, acne vulgaris, eczema and neonatal jaundice.

Light therapy which strikes the retina of the eyes is used to treat diabetic retinopathy and also circadian rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder and can also be used to treat seasonal affective disorder, with some support for its use also with non-seasonal psychiatric disorders.

Basically just follow reddiquette.

**NO LAZY TITLES** Titles for crossposts should either satirize the original or, if you're an uncreative fuck, just use the original. 

Try to post things along the theme.

**DO NOT BRIGADE r/AMITHEASSHOLE** OR ANY SUBS POSTED HERE. This includes: Commenting on, voting on, or messaging any mods in that sub. And if you do, don't post about it here like an idiot because then you become our problem and we're gonna have to ban you. 

**USE THE PROPER FLAIRS**. The following is the proper way you should use flairs:

Validation = Obvious Validation Posts

Self Post = Memes and stuff you make (not text shitposts though)

Fockin ridic = Shitposts that are posted to AITA or posts that are just ridiculous

Shitpost = Any text shitposts you make on this subreddit, or any shitposts related to AITA made on other subs like r/copypasta.

Anus supreme = Obvious YTA posts

Siri Yuss Discussion = Any sort of meta discussion about this sub or AITA

Foreign influence = For obvious fake posts or things of that nature from other subreddits (such as entitledparents or justnomil)

Also the title reads as ""Am I The Angel"" but comments read as ""You Are the Asshole"" if that makes sense. Not sure how it works or how others have been reading it but someone should tell me shit cause I've no clue what I'm doing.

# [Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEurope/wiki/rules)

1. **Be polite and courteous to everybody.**  
No attacks on other users, doxxing, harassment, or trolling. Racism, discrimination or other bigotry (offensive content, hate speech, genocide denial, dehumanisation...) and endorsement of violence will not be tolerated.

2. **Keep comments relevant and of decent quality.**
Top-level comments must answer the question that has been asked. Humorous comments are of course allowed, as long as the question is answered. Low quality comments (""shitposting"") will not be accepted. 

3. **Submissions must be a question with a clear title.**
Submissions must be relevant to the subreddit. They must be a question and have the question in the title, ending with a question mark. Use the text box to clarify the question further if needed. 

4. **No low effort and unsuitable questions.**
Questions that are unsuitable (legal advice, relocation, study advice, work advice, medical advice, general travel advice...) will be removed. This includes [overdone topics](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEurope/wiki/overdone), yes/no-questions, joke questions, and questions which can be easily answered using Google or by visiting the sites linked in the sidebar.

5. **No agenda pushing.**
Don’t push an agenda with your questions: stay neutral. This is a politically neutral sub. You are obviously still allowed to express an opinion as an answer.

6. **No similar questions that have been asked in the last two weeks.**
To keep questions from becoming too repetitive, questions that have been asked during the last two weeks are not allowed. Use the search bar and refrain from asking questions that have already been asked.

**Rules**

Please reads the subreddit rules below before posting. If you are wondering whether your submission is allowed, feel free to send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fasexuality).

**1. No rudeness.**

No derogatory remarks or slurs. No racism, sexism, or other hate speech towards any group (asexual or otherwise). This is meant to be a safe and relaxing space – any submission that detracts from that may be removed.

**2. Certain posts are restricted to Mild Mondays.**

""Mild Mondays"" run from 18:00 UTC on Sunday to 06:00 UTC on Tuesday. The following content should not be posted outside of Mild Mondays.

* Memes,
* common or repetitious jokes,
* objects with asexual colours that were not intended by the creator to symbolise asexuality.

Posts of the form ""repost if..."", ""share if..."", etc. are not allowed on any day of the week.

**3. Mark posts appropriately.**

The following content should be marked appropriately.

* **Aphobia**: Posts which are a screenshot or direct link to aphobia must have the ""aphobia"" flair and be marked as spoiler.
* **NSFW**: Posts containing NSFW written content must be marked as ""NSFW"".

In either case please do not put aphobia or NSFW details in the title of a post. If you need help assigning flairs / marking posts, please [contact a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fasexuality).

**4. Advertising.**

Posts promoting items for reasons other than the benefit of the community will be removed.

**5. No bandwagoning**

Bandwagon posts are not permitted. That is, any content that may be acceptable in isolation but has formed part of a repetitive trend that generates many reposts with little variation. 

Posts with a “share if…” structure are never allowed, regardless of bandwagon status.

306,True,HowAutismWorks,The nature of Autism explained through the science of Cybernetics,r/HowAutismWorks,29,t5_pyw9u,"This sub is dedicated to exploring Jacques Aviles' Autism Feedback Loop theory, wherein Autism is viewed as a *cause-and-effect* cycle in which each and every symptomatic trait (e.g., isolation, low social fluency, rigidity, etc.) helps give rise to and reinforces all others. This cyclical process continues until all traits balance out and the loop the individual is caught in attains a functional enough stasis (the final position or range on the ""spectrum"" where a person can be said to lie).",False,1539717991.0,restricted,pyw9u,False,,"This sub is dedicated to discussing the Autism Feedback Loop and uncovering its mode of operation, only. Any promotion of any other theory or concept (however seemingly worthy or dogmatic), including the demonstrably false ideas that Autism is either the product of genetics or vaccines, will get you permanently banned. Period.

Autism is, and can readily be shown to be (as this sub will make a clear-cut case for), a feedback loop system (i.e., a *cause-and effect* cycle) made up of intertwined vicious and virtuous circles. These are created and sustained by themselves and other environmental stressors (which can and do include the individual's own thoughts and actions); and the resulting coping mechanisms meant to combat them (which themselves eventually promote and become integrated in the larger looped structure as contributory variables, in a manner that ensures their own survival).

Autism, as such, is a schismogenic stress-fueled feedback loop system that arises as a consequence of a breakdown in communication between a child and those around them.",/r/HowAutismWorks/,1539717991.0,r/HowAutismWorks/

###Discord!: [Click Here to Enter](https://discord.gg/TvDz9jB)


####Rules:

 - 1: Be polite, friendly and welcoming.

 - 2: Do not tell anyone they are not forever alone enough to be here. Foreveralone has no firm definition but [here is a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_59IpaAENmI9y0cltCe9oFmjWEelHraq69GEfu-gyTY/edit?pli=1#gid=0) that gives an idea of what it's all about.  Forever Alone is not something you achieve, its something you use to describe yourself.

 - 3: Do not post inflammatory comments or threads designed to generalize, demean, insult or otherwise degrade an entire group of people (race, gender, sexual orientation, religion etc).

 - 4: This is not an incel sub, any incel references, slang, or inference will be deemed hate speech and met with a ban. No ""suifuel"" threads.

 - 5: Avoid posts that serve only to advertise other blogs, subreddits or external sites as we have no control over these external resources. Any such posts may be removed. 

 - 6: If you see trolling, [report it to the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23ForeverAlone&subject=Trolling).

 - 7: Any posts created to intentionally start drama on any subject will be removed.  (i.e. linking other subreddits, crossposts to other subreddits, publicly calling out other users, etc.) This also includes Meta conversations about the sub or Moderation Policy.

 - 8: Do not post your dick.

 - 9: If you have been muted by the mods during a PM conversation, and then directly PM a mod's personal account, you will be banned immediately.

of aviation, there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

##Rules:

1.  **Mods = Gods**  
Do NOT break any rules that the mods might invent on the spot.  

2. **4chan Only**  
Do NOT post anything unrelated to 4chan. Do NOT link directly to 4chan.org. Do NOT post anything from unrelated websites. Screencaps from 4chan are ideal.  

3. **New Content Only**  
Do NOT post screencaps over a year old, do NOT repost, and do NOT omit the date and time stamp. Those posts belong in /r/classic4chan (RIP).

4. **High Quality Only**  
This applies to quality content and quality presentation. Crop your post so it's actually legible. Don't post garbage that isn't entertaining.  

5. **No Redditry**  
Do NOT act like a basic reddit bitch. This includes cliche reddit phrases, subreddit mentions, puns, song lyrics, novelty accounts, getting lots of karma on a single post, sperging out at someone like a 13 year old on Xbox, and other dummy things that make you a manchild.  
E.g. not my proudest fap, /r/theydidthemath, I did nazi that coming, cake day, Fake and Gay, /u/[somethingstupid], 1000 upvotes, etc.  

6. **No Doxxing**  
Do NOT reveal personal information, or post 4chan screenshots that contain personal information of any individual. Do not post 4chan screenshots of Reddit account names or calls for raids. Remember, NYPA.  

7. **No CP**  
Do not post nude images of underage children, or say that nude images of underage children aren't child pornography, or say that nude images of underage children are okay, or describe images of underage children in text form.  
If we see you do this anywhere on Reddit, we will report you to the law enforcement agency of where you live.

8. **NSFW marking**  
Do NOT forget to mark NSFW content. The overall subreddit is SFW, so people need to really know when a submission is legit NSFW. (Potty Words are not NSFW).  

9. **No Grooming**  
No agendaposting.

10. **Admin abuse**  
The admins bypassed the mods and directly took action on the subreddit.

This is not a mental health/advice sub! ",True,1319241233.0,public,2t0gc,False,,"#ALL POSTS REQUIRE APPROVAL
ALL POSTS REQUIRE REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY MODERATOR BEFORE THEY WILL WILL BE VISIBLE. PLEASE BE PATIENT AS THIS MAY TAKE A FEW DAYS DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABILITY OF MODS AND SIZE OF QUE. PLEASE REVIEW RULES BEFORE POSTING TO REDUCE DELAYS.

If your post submission is more than 7 days old in the que, it is auto denied.  This is to keep the que at a level that is manageable for the mods. We apologize for this inconvenience. You can resubmit after 7 days if your post was not approved. Be sure to check rules before re-submission. 

#RULES

### READ BEFORE YOU POST

1. **Do not ask for diagnostic or analytic impressions.** It is unethical to give diagnoses or analyses over the internet. These types of questions are better asked of therapists in person. This also applies to ""advice"" posts.

2. **Questions must be asked clearly in the post title.** Violations of this rule will be removed immediately. You may give additional or clarifying information in the body of your post.

3. **Answers must be evidence-based.** Answers given should reflect the scientific consensus and ideally should cite sources. Anecdotal evidence or pop-psychology will be removed.

4. **No leading questions.** Examples of these questions are: ""Why is Group X so stupid?"" or ""What is wrong with Group X?""

5. **No jokes, memes, insults, or slurs.** This is an academic subreddit, and while discussion is encouraged, any off-topic or non-academic comments will be removed. This includes the use of slang terms or slurs to describe any phenomenon or group of people.

Rules: 

* Your words will mean more if you can support your statements with research.  Unfounded claims will be removed.  Anecdotal claims are appropriate as long as they are stated as such.  (e.g. ""I have found that X works well with my kids,"" versus, ""All students need X."")

* Know your federal, state, and local laws.  They will vary greatly and your laws may not apply to another poster. 

* Links to peer-reviewed research articles from published journals are welcomed. Articles claiming to be research that have questionable authors, limited research, and poor sources will be removed.

* As of October 26, 2020, requests for research are to be posted in the stickied ""Research Participant Requests"" thread.  Standalone posts will be removed and redirected to post there.

**Note:** Since December 2020, Reddit's spam filter periodically breaks for about 48 hours and this problem filters a lot of legitimate comments, when they definitely should not be. Bear with us. When this happens, we have to stem the flow of false positives until this recurring problem clears up. Some posts or comments may take a while to appear, unless they break the rules. Trolls, spammers, agitators, ban evaders and persistent rule-breakers are not tolerated.

---

**/r/NEET Rules**


1. Be nice to each other and don't be an asshole. Insulting NEETs is grounds for permaban.
2. No ableism.
3. No Discord shilling.
4. No agitators; outsiders must behave.
5. Do not post survey threads.
6. Keep any politics non-partisan.
7. No daytrading/crypto posting.
8. No signposting of gender.

#Upcoming AMA posts


*Want to do an AMA? Please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fwriting) to verify yourself before posting. Thank you!* 

---

#Before posting, check out:

## **[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/faq)**
##[Our Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki)
##[Related subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/hub)



Here's a general synopsis and explanation of /r/writing's community rules. Please keep these guidelines in mind for all of your posts and comments. The moderators do reserve the right to remove posts/comments that are deemed harmful without warning and ban users depending on the severity of the infraction.

---



##[Posting Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/rules)

###1. Posting Work
Samples of writing, whether for critique, self-promotion, or general sharing, may only be posted in the weekly self-promotion and critique thread. Requests for writing partners may also only be posted in the critique thread. Requests for school help should be posted in r/homeworkhelp, including posts about school essays or citations.

---

###2. Self-Promotion
We do not allow advertisements for your book, website, new subreddit, etc., or for you to do so on behalf of another company, outside of the self-promotion thread. This includes both posts and comments.

---

###3. Posts should be thoughtful and useful to a broad community of writers
We ask that users frame their posts so they are useful to multiple people. If your post invites answers that are specific to your work alone, it belongs in our brainstorming thread. “Low effort” posts (two lines of text, repetitive questions, etc.) will be removed. Posts focused on personal sharing may only be posted in the general discussion thread.

---

###4. Submission Calls Requirements/AMAs
Calls for submissions (including posts about general writing work) must include 1) payment information; 2) submission deadlines; 3) rights requested; 4) any other relevant information. Directing to a website to answer these questions is not allowed. Please limit yourself to one post per publishing cycle. AMAs may not be posted without mod approval. We prefer subjects be part of the wider writing industry or have done something more than publish a book. Please message modmail for AMA requests.

---

###5. Civility
Treat other people with decency and respect. We encourage healthy debate and discussion, but we will remove antagonistic, caustic, or otherwise belligerent posts. We moderate on tone rather than language.
Racist, homophobic/transphobic, misogynistic, ableist, and other categories of hate speech (including against “acceptable targets”) will be removed. Please report any instances of offensive talk, and the mods will deal with them. Internet vigilantism and doxxing will not be tolerated.

---

###6. Call-out threads and genre/literary-bashing
The forum is a place where we all come together to celebrate what we do: write. We will remove posts: berating other people for their genre/subject/literary taste; adherence or non-adherence to rules; calling people morons for giving a particular sort of advice; insisting that their opinion is the only one worth having; being antagonistic towards particular types of books or audiences; or implying that a particular work is for “idiots”, or “snobs”, etc.

_____________________________________

Help keep the subreddit clean and on-topic by using the report feature to bring attention to rule-breaking posts. If your post has been removed and you do not know why or you have any other questions about these guidelines, please contact the moderators.

## General Rules

1. **Absolutely no bigotry of any kind.** This includes transphobia (including non-binary erasure; see rule 2), homophobia, sexism, ableism, racism, xenophobia, acephobia, truscummery or any other form of marginalization or discrimination.

2. **Bigotry towards non-binary people is transphobia.** Being trans-positive entails being supportive of non-binary people; no exceptions.

3. **No spam.** This includes both advertising and breaking Reddit's site-wide rules, such as vote manipulation or brigading.

4. **Posts must also be topically relevant to trans people or trans issues.**  Political opinions are okay, but users must be respectful of the views of others.  Political posts unrelated to trans topics are subject to removal. *If you want to make political shitposts, please see the list of political trans subs below.*

5. **Selfies are not memes!** Selfies are not memes! This is not a subreddit for selfies. Selfies can be posted in r/transtimelines, r/MTFSelfieTrain, r/FTM_SELFIES, r/nonbinary, and many other places. As for bandwagons such as picrews, lilystory, or other character makers, or anything else bandwagon-y, please direct them to r/traandwagon! For more info, check out the [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/comments/cmk9q7/announcements_decisions_on_bandwagons_plus_the/) about the rule change!

6. **Don't be a dick; have fun!** This is no place for quarrels! Users who fail to be civil will be issued a warning and/or ban. User post history, comment history, and active subreddits will be considered in conjunction with violations of the rules. There will be only one warning. *We do not care if you are right. We care about your attitude.*

7. **This is not a NSFW sub.** This is an all ages sub, so take the NSFW stuff to one of the adult oriented subs. Check out the sidebar to find subs that may be more fitting for that stuff.




## Submission Rules

1. Submissions MUST BE A MEME or they will be removed.

2. Submissions must be an image (.jpg, .png, .gif, .gifv, etc)

3. Image submissions should only link to trusted image sharing sites, e.g. imgur.com, livememe.com, reddituploads.com, giphy.com, and gfycat.com.

4. You are encouraged to post web comics and art from their original artists page rather than rehosting the image some where else. However, Automoderator will remove them, so please [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftraaaaaaannnnnnnnnns) when you do, so we can override it.

5. If you'd like to post reddit threads or messages, take a screen shot and edit out other users' names. This protects privacy and removes the chance for a brigade. [because np.reddit is a joke] 

6. Please do not link to any terf, racist, or any other hate subreddits. Bigots like those do not deserve any attention. Any post or comment linking to a hate subreddit will be removed. Please see the [post guide wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/wiki/postguide#wiki_transphobic_postings) section on transphobic content for more info on this front.

# Comment and submission rules

1) **Be civil**

Do not be abusive or offensive to any user regardless of differences of opinion. Memes and joke comments are not allowed.

######**BEFORE YOU POST OR COMMENT, READ THE RULES:**

>[Click here](/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/rules) for more detailed information on the rules of this sub, our trigger warnings and our tagging practices.

>**When you comment, assume a [context of abuse](/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/assume_a_context_of_abuse) to all posts.**  

>**Be nice.** No personal attacks, name-calling, or bigotry. Exercise empathy. Respect boundaries. No [slurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/slurs) or [victim-blaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/victimblaming).  [Don't downvote.  Speak with your upvotes](/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/downvotes). No fatphobia, transphobia, etc.

>**No posts about politicians or political parties.**

>**No diagnosis by media/drive-by diagnosis.** Do not post about celebrities, people in the media, random strangers or anyone else that you don't personally know. This subreddit is for posts about abusers that you know personally, and that are abusing you personally.

>**Advising anyone in this group to commit suicide or referring them to groups that give this sort of advice will result in an immediate ban.**

>**Respect each other and follow Reddiquette.** Mods may remove posts and comments that are hurtful or not in the spirit of the subreddit at their discretion. Help us preserve a respectful, supportive atmosphere. Your tone matters when responding to others (especially when the post has a ""Suppport"" flair), so please be kind! 

>**Do not [derail](http://bit.ly/1M2zdvP) the posts of others.**

>**No generalizing about groups of people.** This includes race, religion, profession, gender, political party, age, ethnicity, etc.

>**No advocating abusive practices.** This includes current controversial ideas in discipline, medicine, or science that are abusive or misinformative. We stick to the verifiable truth as best we can on RBN, and to advocating healthy practices. This also includes anything relating to theft, slander, lawbreaking, as well as all forms of corporal punishment (i.e.: [no pro-spanking posts or comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/spanking)), anti-vaccination and other pseudoscience. 

>**No encouragement of illegal drug use or self-medication** without medical supervision, and no advising against proper medical treatment.

>**No asking or offering of gifts, money, donations, etc.** No GoFundMe, crowdsourcing or fundraising sites.

>**No links or recommendations to hate groups.**

>**No posts or comments advocating violence, murder or revenge (even in jest).**

>**No posts about N-kids.** 

>**Narcissists are NOT allowed to post or comment here.**

>**No [platitudes or generic advice or motivational posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/rules#wiki_No_platitudes_or_generic_motivational_posts)** Solicited in advice in comments to posters is fine.  Making generic advice posts, such as this title example, is not allowed: Three tips to shut a Narcissist down! No posts like ""ACoNs are an inspiration to me"" or or ""I feel so bad for all of you and I really love my normal parents"" or ""IF I CAN DO IT, YOU CAN TOO!"" or ""You make me a better parent because your posts about the trauma you experienced shows me how to not mess up my kids"". Instead, please support our posters directly by commenting directly on their posts.  Let's keep the people who NEED support in the spotlight and give them direct support!

>**No graphic or clickbait titles.**  [Examples here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7gav2n/read_me_new_guidelines_for_titles_and_trigger/)

>**Please flair triggering content such as graphic physical abuse, sexual abuse or animal abuse.**  The flair button will appear under your post after the post has been submitted.  

>**Maintain anonymity and privacy** [No linking to personal or public Facebook pages, Discords, chat rooms/groups, or identifying information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/chatgroups) Do not ask OPs for more identifying information if it is not provided. Posts that contain an abundance of personally identifying information may be removed to safeguard the community and the poster.

>**You may link an entire sub (for example, /r/BPDlovedones or /r/suicidewatch), but not directly linking to a post/comment.  When you link to a post or comment, please use a np.reddit.com link.  Posts or comments that encourage brigading will be removed.**([Further explanation here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/linkingexceptions)).

>**No pure image posts** - Memes, etc., must be contained within a self-post. ([Example.](http://redd.it/220out)).

>**Moderation in this group is always biased FOR the OP (the person who made the post - not the commenters).**  For example, if an OP does not appreciate comments of a religious nature, the moderators will defend the OP's boundaries.  If an OP prefers comments of a religious nature, the moderators will also defend that boundary. This is a support group - we are all here to support the OP. We often see commenters confused and feel that any comment should be allowed. But, we are biased FOR the OP's needs and boundaries.  When you write your own post asking for support, we will also be biased for you.

>**Please keep in mind that the mods here are unpaid volunteers with their own busy lives and jobs and struggles.**  We are not online 24/7.  We cannot read every post or comment.  We are not omnipotent.  We aren't aware of every problem, so **please use the report button to flag the mods for problematic posts/comments you see in this group.**

>**While you're at it, [check out Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette).**  Not all the guidelines are appropriate for this group, but most are.  It's a good baseline for behavior on Reddit.com in general!

>**Disagree with a Mod decision?  Modmail us!**  Modmail reaches the entire Mod team, we will review and respond as soon as we reasonably can.  Rules lawyering will not help your cause.

-------------------------------------------


>Concealed within the emblematic figures, allegories, and rituals of the ancients is a secret doctrine concerning the inner mysteries of life, which doctrine has been preserved *in toto* among a small band of initiated minds since the beginning of the world. Departing, these illumined philosophers left their formulae that others, too, might attain to understanding. But, lest these secret processes fall into uncultured hands and be perverted, the Great Arcanum was always concealed in symbol or allegory; and those who can today discover its lost keys may open with them a treasure house of philosophic, scientific, and religious truths.

-- **Manly P. Hall, *Secret Teachings of All Ages* (1928).**

>The very word ""secrecy"" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.

-- **John F. Kennedy, 1961.** 

> When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.

-- **Corinthians 13:11-12, NKJV.** 

>The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. 

-- **Edward Bernays, *Propaganda* (1928).** 

> Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world? It is that we have only known the back of the world. We see everything from behind, and it looks brutal. That is not a tree, but the back of a tree. That is not a cloud, but the back of a cloud. Cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face? If we could only get round in front--

**The Light Therapies Reddit**

**Light Therapy** - classically referred to as heliotherapy—consists of exposure to daylight or to specific wavelengths of light using polychromatic polarised light, lasers, light-emitting diodes, fluorescent lamps, dichroic lamps or very bright, full-spectrum light. The light is administered for a prescribed amount of time and, in some cases, at a specific time of day.

One common use of the term is associated with the treatment of skin disorders, chiefly psoriasis, acne vulgaris, eczema and neonatal jaundice.

Light therapy which strikes the retina of the eyes is used to treat diabetic retinopathy and also circadian rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder and can also be used to treat seasonal affective disorder, with some support for its use also with non-seasonal psychiatric disorders.

# Rules:

Full rules and submission guidelines: https://old.reddit.com/r/HumanMicrobiome/about/rules/

1. If you are new to this sub please take some time to review the info in the sidebar & wiki before contributing. This area of research is growing rapidly. If you do not follow the research closely, please refrain from making authoritative statements. 
2. Do not use downvotes for disagreement. Use your words or the report function. We are here to learn and discuss, not to reinforce our preconceived notions. See: https://old.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette
3. Please use the stickied thread to give feedback/suggestions about the sub & its rules. Meta discussion elsewhere will be removed. 
4. This is a science/evidence based sub. Usage of scientific citations to support your claims is highly encouraged and may become mandatory. [Citing your degree/education is almost never appropriate](https://archive.ph/ATJZp#selection-2381.11-2385.1). 
5. Re ""go ask a doctor"". There are times where this is appropriate, and times where it is not. In general, we are here to share evidence-based information, so ""go ask someone else"" isn't a useful contribution. Especially since [most medical providers are not knowledgeable on the majority of information shared in this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/healthdiscussion/comments/8ghdv8/doctors_are_not_systematically_updated_on_the/).
6. Be civil & constructive. Engage in good faith. Trolls/agitators will be banned. Address the arguments, not the person. The subject of your sentence should be ""the evidence"" or ""this source"" or some other noun directly related to the topic of conversation. ""You"" statements are suspect.
7. Memes as top level submissions are not appropriate, but can be posted in the comments. Other low-scientific-quality content may be removed as well. You need to have a good reason for submitting old studies. 

Excessive rule breaking may result in a ban.

1. Follow Reddiquette. Hate speech and bigotry will not be tolerated. 

2. **All direct answers to questions must be from autistic persons.** Having an autistic child/sibling/friend or working with disabled people does not substitute for the lived experience of being autistic. Self-diagnosed autistics are welcome, as not everybody has access to quality diagnostic resources, but please do not abuse this policy if you do not truly believe you are autistic. **Any top-level comments that are suspected to be from an allistic person WILL be removed.**

3. Autistic people have the tendency to be direct, blunt, and possibly emotionally charged while participating in this forum. They are digging through possibly traumatic experiences for your benefit. This is a listening and light discussion space, do not argue, debate, or play ""devil's advocate"" with people answering questions. By particpating in this space, you agree that you may receive responses that cause discomfort, and you agree to manage that discomfort yourself. **However, excessively rude behavior and personal insults are not acceptable for anyone.**

4. Pharmaceutical and medical procedure discussions (for autism) are limited to general anecdotes of safe, legal methods. Discussion of specific regimens of any medication or substance is prohibited, as is discussion of acquiring them. Naturopathy/alt-med, and pseudoscience are strictly not allowed for discussion here. 

5. Research must go through modmail. We only allow research geared for autistic adults that can self-determine their participation. Research on minors or geared towards parents/siblings/professionals is not permitted. 

6. This sub's primary purpose is to provide education about autism. It is not a support group, nor a general discussion space. We are not able to guarantee emotional safety, although moderation of the sub will attempt to create a good experience for autistic people that wish to answer questions as much as possible. If a post appears to be looking primarily for emotional support over learning, or is discussing a very charged or triggering topic, your post may be redirected to other subreddits.

7. Discussion of ABA is limited to the problems with it, and *how* they are problems, not *if* they are problems. This subreddit takes a blanket negative view on ABA and it's taxing on our posters to ask them to repeatedly justify their experiences. 

8. This isn't a forum for allistic people to vent about autistic people, nor is it a place to process interactions with people you only *suspect* have autism. If you're explaining a situation with a person, please keep your post as factual as possible. **If the person you're asking about hasn't told you they're autistic, your question isn't appropriate for this sub.**

9. Please avoid referring to people with functioning labels (e.g. ""high-functioning"".) Either describe the specific need of the person or just say ""autistic"". 

10. We're not parenting coaches or therapy consultants. ""How do I help someone work on____"" questions aren't permitted. Please refer these to the appropriate professionals.

11. If you once owned the mind_blowns account, you're not allowed to be here. There is an entire rule for you now. Go away. Stop making new accounts.

12. Asking if you could be autistic or for people to diagnose you is no longer permitted on this sub. Asking about the actual process of diagnosis is still allowed.",/r/AskAutism/,1496634328.0,r/AskAutism/

* Make sure to [ read the rules!](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/wiki/detailed_rules)

* This subreddit is for asking for objective explanations. It is not a repository for any question you may have.

* E is for Explain - merely answering a question is not enough.

* LI5 means friendly, simplified and layperson-accessible explanations - not responses aimed at literal five-year-olds.

* Perform a keyword search, you may find good explanations in past threads. You should also consider looking for your question in the FAQ.

* Don't post to argue a point of view.


* Flair your question after you've submitted it.

Why Choose Dogecoin?
---
Superfast transactions, no network congestion & transaction fees of 1 dogecoin 

Designed to be actually used day to day. You could buy a cup of coffee without waiting till the shop closes for a confirmation, and also without paying anything close to the cost of the coffee in fees.  

Widely accepted on exchanges; a great tool to move between other crypto-currencies and fiat FAST while keeping fees low. (Try doing that with ANY other coin, they either don’t have the stability, reputation, volume or their fees are CONSIDERABLY higher)  

One of the oldest, well established, tried and true crypto-currencies, There have been considerable ups and downs in the value of the coin in comparison to fiat and other coins however it has stood the test of time and is still widely accepted and has remained a useful tool regardless of its exchange rate. (Which is why you will see 1 Doge = 1 Doge used frequently)
  
Strong positive community. Projects that show humanity, kindness, generosity. Among an ocean of get rich quick schemes, scams, pumps and dumps, this is the only coin which has a community centered on the positive things that crypto-currency can do

#Rules

1. **Be respectful.** There are many diverse viewpoints in the LGBT+ and ASD communities, and in light of this we embrace discussion as long as people adhere to the rules and guidelines. Even if you disagree with another user, don't jump to insults and accusations of bigotry.
1. **No bigotry or hate speech.** Honest questions are fine and the mods won't police your language or phrasing if it's clear you're asking in good faith and interested in learning, but concern trolling and outright slurs will not be tolerated.
1. **Vote responsibly.** Reserve downvotes for content that breaks the rules or fails to contribute to a conversation. Upvote content that encourages discussion and contributes to the community.
1. **No blogspam or soliciting money.**

#Featured Sub » /r/CuriousVideos

---
###About \/r/Videos [chat](https://discord.gg/videos#dis)
* A great place for video content of all kinds. Direct links to major video sites are preferred (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

---
###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) 

#1. Videos Only
* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.

*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos

#2. No Politics
* Political videos—including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)—should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. 

* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)

#3. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting
* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**

* No demanding ""Reddit Justice"" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.

* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.

* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.

* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.

* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**

#4. Submit Direct Link to Video

* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. 

* No URL shorteners. 

* No links to playlists or to channel pages.

#5. No Porn, Gore, or Death.

* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.

#6. No Solicitation of Votes or Views

* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.

* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.

* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like ""this person deserves more views,"" ""not enough people have seen this person's videos,"" or ""show this person some love.""

* Giveaways also fall under this rule

* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.

#7. No Hate Speech

* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.

* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**

* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.

* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)

#8. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts

* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. 

* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.

* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.

* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.

* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout

#9. No Third Party Licensing

* No videos that are licensed by a third party. 

* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. 

* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.

* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.
](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos)

#10. No Self Promotion

* *""It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a youtube channel, it's not okay to be a youtube channel with a reddit account.""* - Confucius

* r/videos is not a platform for you to promote your own content, whilst we do allow OC, any indication that you are heavily pushing your channel on the sub (be it by yourself or a distributed effort) will be met with submission removals and can lead to both a ban from the sub and a permanent sub-wide youtube channel blacklisting.

###Moderation [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos#mods)

#Removals & Warnings
* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.

* *Note: Submissions from new users, and users with low karma, are automatically removed to help prevent spam.*

* Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly! When reporting, please explain why you think it should be removed. 

* **Do not** message moderators individually about posts not appearing in the new queue or ban appeals. Messages should be sent as a modmail to /r/Videos. Failure to do so may result in a ban.


#Submit Feedback

#Ban Appeal Information
To get a ban overturned you will have to submit an appeal. The appeal should display:

-Understanding of why you were banned,

-Remorse for the action(s) and/or...

-Convincing evidence or statement proving that you will not break subreddit rules in the future.

The appeal can be submitted in list or paragraph format (through modmail); but please understand that after the appeal is submitted, there is not a guaranteed removal of the ban. It means that subreddit moderators will discuss in detail whether or not it is appropriate to unban the person in question.

Please allow the moderators a few days after the submission of your appeal to get back to you.",/r/truscum/,1472454702.0,r/truscum/

##**Not A Confession** 

**All submissions *must* be a confession!**

* A confession is an admission of an illegal or immoral action you have intentionally committed that others are not aware of. It cannot be a thought, dream, opinion, kink, etc. Innocent mistakes or accidents are not intentionally committed. You cannot confess the misdeeds of other people. You MUST express regret for your actions in your post. 

* Your confession **must** be an act you committed.

* If your submission does not contain a confession it will be removed.

* An unpopular opinion is not a confession. 

    * Regardless of whatever unpopular opinion you hold, it doesn't classify here as a confession. You haven't done anything wrong, so to speak, so it isn't technically a confession. Better subreddits for this would be /r/offmychest, /r/TrueOffMyChest, /r/rant, or in some cases, /r/relationships.

* Your sexual exploration is not a confession; it's a part of finding out who you are. 

    * /r/confession is not a place for submissions that read like pornography. Despite our confessional theme, we don't find consensual sexual exploits sinful. /r/gonewildstories would be a better place to share.
&nbsp;

##**Be Specific** 

**All confessions must be titled specifically!**

* Your title must relay a brief idea of what wrongdoing you have committed. Submissions with vague titles will be removed.

    We receive a lot of meta-confessions that lump a lot of confessions into one, and a lot of submissions with titles that hardly relate to the confessions within. These kinds of posts don't take the subreddit in the direction we want it to go—it dilutes the content and leads to far more submissions that read like creative writing rather than the thoughts of real people.

    Ideally, your title is a TL;DR of your post.

##**Do Not Encourage Bad Behavior** 

*Helping one another also means that we do not encourage bad behavior.*

We will not accept posts that:

* 2a) encourage rape/rape culture; 

* 2b) sexualise minors;
 
* 2c) are racist; or

* 2d) otherwise promote abusive or hateful behavior.

##**No Relationship Related Posts** 

**/r/confession is not the place to seek relationship advice.**

* Even if your submission contains a confession, relationship-based confessions will be removed. /r/relationships, /r/offmychest, or /r/self would be better places to share. We reserve the right to remove any posts referencing relationships, not just those seeking relationship advice.

##**No Pedophilia Type Posts**

**At this time, this subreddit does not accept pedophile-type confessions, even if the user is seeking help and/or working on their situation.**

* In the past these types of confessions have been a fine line between acceptable and sexualizing minors. We recommend you seek out sources such as:

    * http://www.virped.org/ (18+ Only);

    * A counselor that can effectively aid you; or

    * Another subreddit like /r/self, or /r/offmychest. However, we do not know their stance or moderation policy on pedophile-type posts.

    Unfortunately, We are not well versed in the help that may be available. Hopefully this is a starting point for you.

##**Limited Context**

**We do not accept posts with limited context.**

* Confessing only the barest of snippets or most cryptic of details isn't the purpose of this sub. Understanding what you're confessing shouldn't be like pulling teeth, context is important.

&nbsp;

##**No Politics**

**Political-themed posts are not allowed.** 

* There are plenty of subs around Reddit to discuss your political views. 
 
&nbsp;

##**Meta Posts** 

**Meta posts are for moderator use only.**

&nbsp;

# Commenting Rules


##**Be Kind and Civil** 

**This is a place to help one another; keep your comments kind & civil. Any form of abuse is not permitted.**

* If you are unable to discuss without being disrespectful, walk away.


##**No False Post Accusations** 

**Accusations of fake posts are not allowed.**

* If you're posting on /r/confession, chances are you're not in the best frame of mind to be fielding attacks on your credibility by the vast and uncaring anonymous internet. We instituted this rule to better protect our submitters and provide a more constructive rather than detractive environment.

* You may report spammy posts, but commenting solely to try to discredit the experience an OP has claimed to have is at best nonconstructive and at worst genuinely hurtful. Please message the moderators so they may decide if it should be taken down instead. 

* This extends to any harassment of OP.

##**No Trolling** 

**No memes, trolling, or otherwise blatantly low-effort content.**

* There are many subreddits for us to fool around. This is a place for us to stay on topic. Comments and replies should be of substance and contribute to the conversation.

&nbsp;

##**Do Not Doxx** 

**No attempts to identify OP.**

* Not only is it against sitewide rules, but attempts to identify posters undermines the comfort and reassurance that lies in anonymity. 

##**Removal Appeal Process**

Follow the steps below to have your comment or post approved:

1. Read the rules to determine which was violated,

2. Remove the offending portion of your post or comment,

3. Message the moderators to have the post or comment approved (skip to this step if the removal was in error).

*We abide by a three strike system here. Three rule violations will result in at least a three day ban.*

---

##**Ban Appeal Process**

> Follow the steps below to have your ban reversed.

* Read the rules and review your post history to determine why you were banned
* Message the moderators with a case as to why your ban should be reversed. This should be based on the information in the first step. (If the ban was in error, skip to this step)

---

**Subreddit Rules:**

We ask that users kindly obey the following set of ground rules:

1. **Posts must be on-topic to neuroscience and academic in nature.** 

2. **Link posts are limited to academic journal content.** Domains on our whitelist are auto-approved; all others are screened by the moderator team. To see the current whitelist please [see this wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/wiki/index#wiki_whitelisted_sites) and [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/neuroscience) to request changes to it.

3. **Pop-science articles, news summaries of academic articles, and blog-spam are not allowed.** If you wish to post a news summary - first create a link post for the academic article (even if behind a paywall) and then post the news summary in the comments. 

4. **Text posts are limited to in-depth discussions that are academic in nature.** All text posts are pre-screened by the moderator team before appearing on the front-page to ensure quality. This will come down to the subjective judgement of the moderator team, but discussions about research methods or a breakthrough concept are two examples of posts that are likely to be considered academic in nature. 

5. **No medical advice questions, questions about your personal health situation, or drug use questions.** If you must solicit advice on these topics from the internet, see /r/AskDocs and /r/AskDrugNerds, respectively.

6. **No top-level text posts of quick questions that Wikipedia or Google could answer.** Our stickied [Beginner Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/mia85f/beginner_megathread_3_ask_your_questions_here/) is the appropriate forum for short form discussion.

7. **No top-level text posts about school or career path questions.** Our [School and Career Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/juu28q/school_career_megathread/) is the appropriate forum for discussion about these topics. (We’ll be stickying this megathread after a week or so once the rule changes are no longer new and we have a sticky slot available.)

8. **No undisclosed self-promotion.** Message the moderator team to request pre-approval for anything that promotes yourself, your employer, or something you made or contributed to.

>&nbsp;

>**1. RULE X: SRS is a circlequeef and interrupting the circlequeef is an easy way to get banned.** Do not say a comment is ""not that bad"". Do not defend linked comments. Do not play Devil's Advocate. Do not attempt to start a debate. This list is not exhaustive. You will not get a warning. 

> This is **our space** to vent amongst like-minded people. We will not tolerate rude interruptions. Also, you are not entitled to ""explanations"" just because you come across our sub. 

>**2.** [ShitRedditSays is not a downvote brigade.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/czfg0u4?context=5)  **Do not downvote any comments in the threads linked from here!**  Pretend the rest of Reddit is a museum of poop. Don't touch the poop. (Commenting in linked threads is fine.)

>**3.** No ""ironic"" or ""satirical"" use of **slurs.** Please censor quoted slurs.

>**4.** No violent rhetoric.

#### [](#h4-green)

>**HOW TO POST**

>&nbsp;

>**5.** Only submit horrible **comments** that have been **upvoted** above a net score of **+20**. If a thread has multiple shitty comments, feel free to [compile them in an effortpost.](http://redd.it/ohdqz)

>**6.** Focus on the **large, mainstream subreddits.** [Low-hanging fruit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/wiki/lowhangingfruit) from obvious [hate groups](http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2012/spring/misogyny-the-sites), circlejerks, troll subreddits, and the like can be submitted to the low-hanging fruit megathread located at the top of the sub.

>Subreddits for kids are also off limits. They're still young, so they get a chance to grow out of their edginess.

>**7. Titles** should be **direct quotes of comments** (NO EDITORIALIZING) followed by **the number of total votes** in brackets like this: [+30]. (Effortpost titles can be anything.)

>**8.** Submissions must be the **direct permalink to the comment**. If the comment you're linking to requires some **context**, just add `?context=x` to the URL, where `x` is the number of parent comments you want displayed.

>**9.** Don't link to threads you're involved in, or to shit you just disagree with

> **10.** Don't submit **[META]** posts without contacting the mods first. 

> No posting questions or ""discussions"" about feminism, social justice, etc. These belong in one of the appropriate Fempire discussion subs, such as /r/SocialJustice101 or /r/SRSDiscussion.

>**11.** [No np links](http://redd.it/39nwjh)

The most important rule is **Just Post Anything Aspergers**. If you've never had a post or comment removed it means you haven't been posting enough.

Our unique rule is that **all posts need to be titled ""aspergers irl""**. Posts that aren't are automatically removed. 

We do not allow posts that reference suicide. This community is not equipped to handle this topic. If you are feeling suicidal, [the me irl wiki has some resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/wiki/suicideprevention) to guide you to people who help.

**Don't post NSFW**, or openly sexual. Even if you tag it.

**Avoid screenshots that are mostly text**, and feel contrived and performative. Show don't tell!

If you are in urgent need of support - please see /r/CPTSD /r/MentalHealth or /r/MentalHealthSupport",False,1575092664.0,public,29d1d7,False,,"Rules.

1. Don't be a jerk. This means if you have a different opinion speak to the idea itself, not the person. People can discuss and debate. But this is still a support community for trauma survivors. 

2. Racism, bigotry, misogyny/misandry, far right ideology, TERF nonsense, and other hate speech is unacceptable.

3. Please try to be respectful of others by using [Trigger Warning], NSFW and/or the spoiler tag whenever appropriate.

4. Posts seeking support are allowed. But all such posts should have the words ""only support wanted"" somewhere in the title. If they do not a person can reasonably assume interpretation or discussion is valid. It can be lowercase, capitalized, whatever. But if a person only wants support they have to make that clear in the title.

5. Self promotion posts are allowed. Other subs, blogs, Youtube channels, anything trauma or healing related at all is allowed. But that is starting a discussion as well, self promotion cannot be simply support seeking, it will require resiliency and an openness to discussion in the comments.

6. The trauma olympics are allowed. Rule 1 still applies. But some survivors wish to look at ACE scoring and the question of whether, as an intellectual or scientific idea, if some trauma is worse than others. Of course others can disagree with that and can say so, but if the discussion is not personalizing it is allowed. 

7. All content must be related to trauma or healing directly, or must speak to the persons lived experience.

# 📃 [Posting Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/wiki/post_and_content_guide/)

**Examples of what we love to see:**

* Witchy, uplifting content with a feminist twist is most encouraged. Extra points for humour! We love humour with our magic. ✨ WVP is curated to maintain a warm, hopeful, supportive, and uplifting environment.

*  We allow selfies [limit 2/wk], self-promotion, & original content. Please flair accordingly. See our [Market Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/wiki/marketplace_vendor_guide) if you are self-promoting. Selfies should be appropriate for a safe-for-work subreddit. All content should fall under our first guideline's witchy-themed umbrella. 

* We love pictures of familiars, pets, & animal friends that do not focus on their death, injury, or illness. 

* WVP is a gender-inclusive, woman-centric subreddit. This means we are uplifting the voices of women & those that fall under the LGBT+ umbrella regarding gender identity & expression. 

* When sharing artwork & media other than your own original content please remember to credit creators & artists.

Good topics for discussion here include:

* Exploring public attitudes to non-neurotypical people.

* Looking at the stereotypes and tropes through which psychological and neurological differences are represented.

* Highlighting some of the prejudice that people who are not neurotypical can face.

* Discussing the value of medical language for understanding particular kinds of neurodiversity. 

* Celebrating some of the positive aspects of neurodiversity.

One of our central aims is to create an environment for promoting the understanding and acceptance of people with neurological and psychological differences while acknowledging the unique and often serious problems these people may face. In particular, this should be a safe space for those who are not neurotypical to talk freely without fear of prejudice, and abuse or hate speech directed at non-NTs will be deleted. Other kinds of prejudice (e.g. on the basis of sex, sexuality, gender, race, or ability) will also result in comments being removed.

Discussion of any type of interpersonal relationship involving at least one neurodivergent person is allowed here. These include but are not limited to platonic, romantic, sexual, business, and familial relationships.

""Neurodivergent"" is used here as an umbrella term for any mental functioning which diverges from what is clinically expected. This can include mental illness, mental disability, psychological trauma, phobias, eating disorders, psychosis, insomnia, compulsive behavior, addiction, or any mental health issues which hasn't yet been defined. We are not using the term ""neurodivergent"" to downplay the negative effects of mental illness and disability.

Basic reddiquette rules apply. In addition, here are some guidelines specific to the nature of this subreddit.

**You may:**

* discuss potentially triggering topics, so long as appropriate post flair is used.

* discuss NSFW topics, so long as appropriate post flair is used.

* discuss safe and responsible use of controlled substances.

* suggest that a user leave a relationship if you judge it to be toxic (unless they specifically ask not to give that type of advice in their post).

* suggest that a user or someone in their life seek professional help.

* post on-topic memes.

* message moderators for approval to post advertisements.

**You may not:**

* seek diagnosis or attempt to diagnose other users. This includes ""do you think my boyfriend is a narcissist/sociopath"" type posts (which also usually demonize conditions). Recommending that a person research a condition/spectrum is allowed.

* spread false information, including antivaxxing propaganda or ""cures"" for genetic disabilities.

* gaslight another user or try to make them question reality, even jokingly. This can trigger psychotic and dissociative episodes in people prone to them.

* describe any neurodivergent person as a burden to you by nature of their neurodivergence. If something specific about their relationship with you stresses you out, feel free to post about it, but *don't talk about them as if they're useless or inferior*. This type of talk is psychologically damaging to neurodivergent readers.

* recommend forced drugging or forced institutionalization. Institutions and medical professionals aren't guaranteed to treat neurodivergent people in a safe or dignified way in those situations, especially if a patient's mental condition is heavily stigmatized. These experiences are frequently traumatizing, and you can't know how a stranger would respond to them based off of a reddit post. The OP may also live in an area which handles neurodivergent people's civil rights differently than yours does.

* trivialize mental conditions (examples: ""it bothers me when my room isn't clean, I'm sooo ocd haha!"", ""just go outside and exercise and you'll be fine, you don't need medication"")

* stigmatize or demonize any mental condition, *including personality disorders and psychosis*. No mental condition forces everyone who experiences it to abuse others, and spreading the idea that they do hurts members of our community.

* victim blame.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Couple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Cool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don't we need those? Copy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Chemical-y. Careful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Candy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Coming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point!",/r/FCMemes/,1553635407.0,r/FCMemes/

Excellent introductory lecture on ADHD: what it is, how it affects those who have it, how to treat it to treat, and the potential consequences of not treating it. It is split into segments for easy watching. By Dr. Russell Barkley.

It isn't to try and condemn guys who have this going for them, but to try and increase self awareness and not give too much credit to men who wish they were women.  
The number one sign of having this is when a straight man wishes that he was a woman. A very common manifestation of AGP is when a man feels that he is a lesbian trapped in a male's body. Some honorable mentions of AGP signs might be when the MtF has male hobbies and interests, or mental health problems that men are much more likely to have, such as aspergers.

Not for opinions, not for relationship advice, and not for preaching.",True,1382338749.0,public,2yuqy,False,,"# 1. Feel free to speak your mind 

* This is a place where all who want to get something off their chest, can get something off their chest. The Mods at /r/TrueOffMyChest will never enforce any rules that exclude any race/gender/etc. or other views from posting in /r/TrueOffMyChest. We ask that you do the same.

# 2. Do not break sitewide rules

* Due to the nature of this subreddit, telling anyone to kill themselves will be an automatic, permanent ban. This is a place where people come to share some of their darkest secrets, things that might already put them into a volatile mental state. Again, there is a no tolerance policy for this.

* Posts involving pedophilia or minors in sexual situations will likely be removed

* Posts wishing violence on anyone will be removed.

* Begging for karma is against Reddit ToS and will be removed.

# 3. Posts must be on topic

* No Circlejerking - Repeated posts on the same topic within a 24 hour period is considered circlejerking. Please find an active thread on the topic and participate by commenting.

* No blanket statements

* No hot takes

* No impersonal opinions, political or otherwise

* No generalizations

* Obviously fake stories will be removed

* Political topics are fine but they must be in ""off my chest"" fashion.  

* More information on what types of posts are allowed here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/m501ud/what_does_personalized_off_my_chest_style_post/

# 4. Comments must be civil and respectful of OP

* Scolding/insults toward OP is not allowed, no matter what their opinions are. Egregiously breaking this rule may result in a ban.

# 5. Be mature 


* Off-topic comments are rude and will be removed.

* Calm debates are fine,  name-calling and arguing is not. Comments should be well-thought out and reasonable and have the goal of productive conversation with others, even if  there is a disagreement

* Please engage the community in good faith and do not test the limits of the mod team

# 6. Do not disclose personal information about yourself or others 

* Do not reveal personally identifiable information. Consider creating a new reddit account just for your post.

* Do not attempt a witch hunt. This includes referencing another user's reddit history.

* Do not ping users who are not already in the thread. Pinging someone in order to harass them is a bannable offense

# 7. Posts must be personal and in ""off my chest"" style

* If your post isn't personal in nature or in ""off my chest"" style, it will be removed. If you want to talk about something, it either has to be directly related to you or directly impacting you - no soapboxing or hot takes/unpopular opinions.

# 8. No financial transactions

* Do not offer money, give money, or request money. This is a bannable offensive with zero tolerance.

  
We also heavily encourage our users to follow the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) 

##Other Information

This subreddit is **not** considered a safe space for any particular group. If you are in need of one, the original /r/offmychest maintains one (Mostly for common safe spaces such as LGBT, Domestic Abuse, Sexual Abuse). All posts, besides blatant trolls or excessive circlejerking, are allowed and we will not take them down.

## CMH Rules & Guidelines



**1. Gentleness.** Whether in a post, comment, or User Flair, speak gently, not abrasively. No profanity, slurs, blasphemy, bullying, trolling, or naming-names in a complaint (e.g. other subs/users).

**2. Oversimplifying.** Avoid “waving the Magic Jesus Wand” at people. Healing is often complex, so statements like “Just pray more” or “Just give your heart to Jesus” can add feelings of guilt or failure to an already difficult burden.

**3. Humility.** Share & explain, don't declare & debate. Instead of telling people what to do, try a ""stories, ideas, and options"" approach. When you're unsure what someone hopes for, ask and let *them* decide, then just listen and respond accordingly.

**4. Evangelism.** Whatever faith you may practice, evangelizing is only fine *IF* it was invited by the other person.

**5. Self-help materials.** Quoting/paraphrasing is fine! Promoting/advertizing is not.

**6. Editing.** Comments can take lots of thought, heart, and work, and it's sad to feel misunderstood or wish you could take your own words back. So, edit freely whenever you need to, and allow for others who choose to do this as well.

**7. Privacy.** Rather than initiating a PM, *comment* to the person on how you can relate to them, and ask if they'd like to PM. Also, while ""context"" details like age/gender can aid discussion, sharing personal details like your name is unnecessary and risky.

**8. ""Experts.""** To post/comment while claiming “I'm a licensed/certified expert,” contact the mods to get verified.

**9. Blogs, articles, & other links.** Any link conducive to the sub's purposes is welcome. If you *disagree with, question, or simply aren't sure about* material you want to link, make a self post and put the link in the text box.

**10. Discretion with greater Reddit.** While this should be a safe place to express pain, links or explicit references to other Reddit subs/users can cause significant drama, as this sub is not private. So for links, use np.reddit (np.reddit.com/r/SubredditName/postname), and use general references instead of names (""another sub/thread/user"").

---

If you see a rule violated, click that **report** button and **message the mods with a link** to the comment/post! This helps us to see and address the problem.

Rule| Details
---|---
1. Your post should be relevant, encourage discussion, and be inclusive. | We prefer that titles be in the form of a question, but if this is not possible, please make sure either the post title or content provides a starting point for discussion. -- Use inclusive language e.g. Not ""How did you ladies choose a female name?"" but instead ""How did you find your new name?""
2. Be respectful, especially about how people identify themselves. | No bigotry (transphobia, homophobia, sexism, racism, etc); no hateful speech or disrespectful commentary; no personal attacks; no [gendered slurs](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderedslurs); no [invalidation](/r/asktransgender/wiki/invalidation); no [gender policing](/r/asktransgender/wiki/genderpolicing); no shaming based on stealth, open or closeted status.
3. No personal agendas. | /r/asktransgender is a place for discussion and is not a soapbox. If a post or comment indicates a personal agenda, or if it's clear they have not come here with an open mind, their post(s) will be removed.
4. No stirring the pot. | Please do not post threads that intentionally create drama, target a different sub or link to threads in a different sub, or otherwise encourage brigading.
5. Minors **under the age of 13** are not allowed on reddit. We are required to report members identifying as such to the reddit admins.  | ""Although we welcome users from all walks of life, reddit is not aimed at children, and the United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Individuals under the age of 13 may not create an account with us. If you believe someone 12 or younger is using our site without parental consent, please contact us.""

Additionally, note that we do not allow fundraising posts/requests under any circumstances.
7. Posts with NSFW content must be marked. | Posts that center around genitals, breasts, sex, or content you would not discuss with coworkers, your grandmother, or other delicate company should be marked as NSFW.
8. No fetishizing or chasers | We will remove any posts treating trans bodies as fetishes or objects, and any posts that indicate your attraction is more important than your partner's dysphoria.

Rules:

1. Be fully transparent.
If you have not been clinically diagnosed, please don't claim to have autism.

2. We can not advise you on whether you may have autism.
""Am I autistic?"" and ""Is this a symptom of autism?"" posts are not allowed. However, seeking advice on how to proceed with the medical diagnosis process is permitted in the Diagnosis FAQ megathread (see Rule 8)

3. Undiagnosed individuals are welcome to ask questions, as long as they don't break the rules.
For example, if you suspect you may have autism or know someone that does, you are welcome to seek advice on how to access resources or cope with ASD symptoms. Please just be transparent about dx status.

4. No implying that autism is not inherently a disability.
Perpetuating the notion that the Social Model of Disability implies that autistic people are solely ""disabled by barriers in society and not by their own impairment or difference"", is not permitted.

5. Be kind and respectful.
Disagreements happen. Keep it civil. Posts or comments antagonizing others will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned.

6. Cite your sources.
Claims about autism's clinical presentation, statistics, history, etc. must have sources cited. Anecdotal evidence may not be used to make broad statements about autism.

7. Posts must contribute to a meaningful discussion without being redundant.
No ""preaching to the choir"". ie. Posts complaining about how selfdx isn't equivalent to clinical dx aren't allowed as this is something that we all already agree on.

8. Diagnosis related questions are only permitted in the Diagnosis FAQ megathread.
There is a pinned [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismCertified/comments/113g47i/diagnosis_faq_megathread/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for asking questions about diagnosis. Please read the [Diagnosis FAQ wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismCertified/wiki/index/faq) before asking follow-up questions in the megathread. Posts outside of the megathread will be removed. Comments asking questions already addressed in the FAQ wiki will be removed.",/r/AutismCertified/,1675902176.0,r/AutismCertified/

There are 4 types of OSDD, but the most common is OSDD-1 which is similar to DID.  In OSDD-1, severe childhood trauma causes different identities, known as alternate states of consciousness (alters) to form.  These alters protect the main identity from awareness of trauma.

For those who have stumbled across this subreddit and don't know what voidpunk is, here you go:

Voidpunk is a subculture for those who often feel rejected or disconnected from humanity. This is popular within aro-spec and ace-spec communities but also includes groups such as neurodivergent people, disabled people, non-binary people, POC, and other groups that are frequently dehumanized or called 'subhuman' by society. Voidpunk is based on embracing the idea of being 'not human'. While many of these marginalized groups seek to prove their humanity to their oppressors, voidpunk aims to, instead of claiming humanity, instead, recognizes that these oppressors are bigoted and taunts them by saying ""Maybe I am not human by society's standards. What about it?"" Voidpunk rejects to define humanity, as every attempt at a definition will inevitably be wrong.

If you don't follow society's requirements for being human, why try to be human? Be you.

# Rules

1. **Be Respectful (No Personal Attacks/Witch-Hunts)**
We’re here for discussion and debate, but we are not here for blatantly rude comments that some may consider offensive or harmful. Name-calling, homophobic, racist, sexist, and misogynistic posts will be automatically removed. Users will also be given warning via direct message when their comments are deemed inappropriate. Multiple warnings may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. When possible, we try to talk things through as adults first, before straight up banning.

2. **Rule 2 - Keep it Hamilton Focused**
This is a sub for the City of Hamilton, Ontario. Post about things happening in our community, newsworthy, events, and other helpful contributions often go a long way. Posts about neighbouring cities don’t tend to do well here, and we would consider posting in their appropriate sub. We also suggest using our “search” feature for commonly asked questions, like “I’m moving to Hamilton from…” or “where to find….” Often times, with a sub as old as ours, the questions have previously been answered. If you’re looking for Hamilton the Musical, we would consider posting to r/hamiltonmusical.

3. **Rule 3 - Slurs and/or Hate Speech**
Hate speech is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as ”public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation”. - Such content will not be allowed on our sub, and is also part of reddit’s Global Content Policy. Hate is defined as: feel intense or passionate dislike for (someone)(verb) Or intense or passionate dislike (noun).

4. **Rule 4 - Security Camera Footage, Pictures Containing Faces (where consent wasn't given), Dash-Cams , Stolen Items, Missing Persons:**
To help ensure privacy, prevent doxxing, personal attacks, and misinformation, and to also be respectful of a persons right to innocence until proven guilty, we cannot allow posts of these types to be shared in r/Hamilton. This is unless it comes from a police/government or news agency. If a photo contains a person/persons, and they did not verbally consent to having their picture taken, it is expected that the face be altered in such a way that the individuals not be easily identifiable. 

5. Rule 5. **Editorialized Headlines**
When posting an article from an outside source, we ask that you leave the title of the original post as is, unless it is automatically populated incorrectly - at which point, we would ask that you take the heading/headline of that page and post it exactly as it appears. The reason for this is to ensure that the context in which the item was created is presented as it was meant to be displayed. Additional commentary or notes can always be added in the comment replies.

6. Rule 6. **Spam/Obvious Self Promotions**
Things that are obviously spam will be removed automatically. Same with obvious self-promotional plugs/videos. While things like car-washes, lemonade stands, and general event promotions are fine, these should be posted in our weekly Marketing Monday sticky. All promotions will be automatically flagged and will be reviewed by the mod team.

7. Rule 7. **Reddiquette / Reddit Content Policy**
Additionally, we suggest using Reddiquette and adhering to Reddit’s Global Content Policy.

8. **Rule 8 - Moderator Discretion** 
Moderators retain discretion to remove a post at any time if they feel it is violating Reddit rules, or are intended to only incite abuse, are trolling, or are deemed offensive in some way. This includes, but is not limited to, reposts, hate messages, self-posts that cover already heavily discussed topics. The same rule also applies for suspicious karma farming posts and accounts.

9. **Rule 9 - Contacting the Mods**
When contacting the mods, we ask that you [contact us via modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Hamilton) and not to our individual DM's or Chats. This ensures that all of the mod team can see your messages, and allows us to keep our personal accounts to ourselves. **Any messages related to the business of our sub sent to our personal accounts will not be responded to.**

The full rules are found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/toastme/about/rules/). In summary see below:

-1. Be kind and make someone feel good! No insults. report any comments that violate this rule. Mods will deal with the bad behaviour.

-2. No advice. No ratings. ! Moderators will remove comments and/or posts that are asking for advice/ratings. Only comedy over-scores or full marks are acceptable

-3. All posts must contain a verification note. For [full details:](https://redd.it/f56itf) Brief: A **physical sign/note** with your u/ or username and ""Toast Me!"" on it, both clearly legible. Your username must match your account exactly! Verification featuring an image of a person CANNOT be digitally added. It must be a piece of paper or a physical object.

-4. Advertising/Self-Promotion: Toastme is not a subreddit for product advertisement, promoting a career or asking for money/donations (including youtube or similar). Posts outright asking doing so on the sub or by DM will be removed. 

-5. Final Word/NSFW. Moderators have the final word. If we deem something unsuitable, we remove it. If you deem something unsuitable, report it, don’t pick a fight over it.  Due to concerns raised by our subscribers, pictures of shirtless/showing a lot of “décolletage” will be marked as NSFW. Full nudity will be removed. Injury content will be removed. Links to such will be removed.

-6. Please do not judge others' motivation for posting - there's no such thing as karma-whoring here! Accusations of such and rudeness may result in bans.

-7. Age (U13) & reddit's content policy: Minimum age to post is **13 years old**, so behave around them! There is a difference between telling someone they look pretty and then sexualising them/their attributes.

-8. No Sexual Comments: Applies to all ages. Comments resorting to sexual comments/sexually harassing will be removed and the responder risks being banned.

-9. Self Harm/Suicidal Ideations: Posts prominently showing self harm scars/injuries  or express current thoughts of suicide will be removed and OP will be directed to support. Remember, if you feel this way, please seek professional help. Toastme and Reddit is in no way a substitute for real life help.

#Hearing from someone you don't want to by PM? 
-As positive a place as this is, there are still ""ne'er do wells"" who forget how to talk to people like proper human beings. Please let the mods know if you are getting Private Messages (PM's) as a result of posting on Toastme which upset or harass you. 
If you do not wish to receive PM's from anyone except trusted users, visit the desktop version of your Reddit settings profile [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/blocked) and set it accordingly.

#####Community Rules
1. Only Parents or Guardians May Create New Posts
 * Parents/guardians are any person who has substantial decision-making authority in a child's life. However, it’s okay for anyone to comment, provided it’s on-topic and within rules. Indicate you're a parent or guardian, or self-select your user flair, to avoid confusion/accidental moderation. Non-parents/guardians that still have pressing questions for parents can utilize the weekly ""Ask Parents Anything"" thread in this sub or visit r/AskParents.
1. Be Decent & Civil
 * Remember the Human! Disagree but remain respectful; don’t insult people or their children, name-call, or be intentionally rude. Bullying, including baiting/antagonizing, and brigading of either individual users or subreddits will not be tolerated. Reporting posts that violate this rule is the best way to get it noticed by the moderation team.
1. No Medical & Legal Advice
 * Reddit and the internet, in general, are not the best places to get or give medical or legal advice. Support for established medical and legal situations is allowed. Do not ask about symptoms, post pictures, or ask if you should seek a medical professional. Do not ask if something is legal/illegal, if you should call the police, engage an attorney, or call child welfare agencies. Commenters should not offer medical or legal advice. Always consult a professional in these matters. Additionally, you may also consider posting on r/legaladvice for legal advice.
1. No surveys, studies, or interviews
 * Absolutely no surveys, studies, petitions, interview requests or invitations to participate are permitted. This includes anything done for profit, academia, school, free, or for personal information. Please consider posting instead to r/samplesize.
1. No linking, promotion, or advertising
 * We do not allow spam, self-promotion, marketing research, fundraising, petitions, solicitation of feedback, or any material that looks to use the community for benefit of themselves or anybody else. Non-promotional linking is also discouraged, especially if it's the main focus of the submission.  This rule applies to both posts and comments.
1. We are a discussion-first sub
 * This subreddit is discussion-based, and does not want blog posts, YouTube channels, open letters, pictures, or memes, or anything similar. This rule applies to posts and comments. Please check our [recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits) for other communities to post to.
1. No Sexual Content Involving Minors
 * Most content describing sexual acts that involve minors (even when no adults are involved) will usually be removed. Self-exploration and sex can be a normal part of human growth and development. If you are worried your child is outside the range of normal please see a professional for advice. If you are worried about the sexual abuse of a minor please see your child's doctor, local police, or child welfare agency as soon as possible.
1. General Posting and Moderation
 * Moderators can remove or approve any content at their discretion. If you feel something of yours was erroneously removed - reach out. We'd be glad to discuss it cordially. We only discuss moderation with the impacted user, not general curiosity seekers. Please help us by reporting posts and comments that don't meet the standard of our community for review! Your human moderators thank you for your patience and understanding.
1. **Rule P** - No Photos of Children
 * Sometimes you want to post a picture of your little one, maybe to illustrate something that's happened to them, or to just share!  We currently do not allow pictures of your little ones to be posted here, due to privacy and safety concerns.  Please check out our [recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits) for other communities to post to instead!
1. **Rule S** - Things My Kid Said Threads
 * We have the **""Things My Kid Said""** weekly thread about things your kids have said.  Please consider saving your submission for this thread instead!

&nbsp; Welcome to /r/YoungEntrpreneurs - the community where self-motivated, high-functioning and success-driven ""Millennials"" & ""Post-Millennials"" can openly cultivate, share, live and learn the lifestyle of entrepreneurship. 

&nbsp; In homage of the original creator /u/rockyvy, the following ideals will remain the same. More content will be actively added in the near future!

&nbsp; Although entrepreneurs of all backgrounds may face similar challenges in starting up, being young is especially different. Either it's an advantage or a handicap, we would like to share ideas and tips for young 'treps everywhere.

Let's start discussions about 

* Success stories from actual young entrepreneurs
* Hands-on experiences and case studies
* Failures from actual events
* Collegiate courses on entrepreneurship
* How-to's in starting up and running a business for young 'treps
* Mentors, inspirational people


&nbsp; While there is absolutely no age requirement to be a part of the community, please keep in mind that a majority of other members have the possibility of being significantly younger in both age and experience. 

&nbsp; Many existing communities for entrepreneurs, while certainly providing positive and beneficial substance to all ages, sometimes have condescending tendencies toward those that may be less experienced. Depending on the type of person or situation, actions such as this could push the disparaged individuals away from wanting to seek an entrepreneurial lifestyle. 

&nbsp; Anybody witnessing such negative misconduct taking place is openly encouraged to report the behavior to any of the mods, and it will be handled accordingly. If you have to be warned twice, then you will be put on a temporary ban from the community. Afterwards, if you have to be warned a third time, then it will come in the form of a permanent ban. We are here to learn from each other, not put anybody else down.

&nbsp; Please read the Wiki before making a new post - there are only a few guidelines we prefer the adherence of (Wiki IN PROGRESS)",/r/YoungEntrepreneurs/,1358186981.0,r/YoungEntrepreneurs/

>A community of Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs), Speech Therapists (STs), Speech-Language Therapists (SLTs), Clinical Fellowship Clinicians (SLP-CFs), Speech-Language Pathology Assistants (SLPAs), graduate students, graduate clinicians, and undergraduate students. We discuss therapy ideas, share stories, share informative links, and give general advice through our personal experience and research. 

----------------------------------

>Speech-Language Pathologists, sometimes called speech therapists, assess, diagnose, treat, and help to prevent communication and swallowing disorders in patients. Speech, language, and swallowing disorders result from a variety of causes such as a stroke, brain injury, hearing loss, developmental delay, a cleft palate, cerebral palsy, or emotional problems. 

>Speech-language pathologists work with patients who have problems with speech, such as being unable to speak at all or speaking with difficulty, or with rhythm and fluency, such as stuttering. They may work with those who are unable to understand language or with people who have voice disorders, such as inappropriate pitch or a harsh voice. Find out more about SLPs [here](http://www.asha.org/Students/Speech-Language-Pathology/) and [here](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Healthcare/Speech-language-pathologists.htm#tab-2). 

----------------------------------

>If you have a speech or language concern, please contact your local speech therapist. You can find a therapist in your area using [ASHA's Professional Finder](http://www.asha.org/findpro/). Speech pathologists can talk about language, development, and the field in general, but they **cannot diagnose or treat** in this subreddit.

----------------------------------
>Feeling burn out or job stress? Consider talking to a mental health professional or researching strategies for anxiety, stress, and depression. Just as we cannot diagnose/treat speech and language disorders in this subereddit, we can only offer support, not true mental health counseling.

**The Microbiome Reddit**

**Microbiome** - an ""ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms"" found in and on all multicellular organisms studied to date from plants to animals. A microbiota includes bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi and viruses. Microbiota have been found to be crucial for immunologic, hormonal and metabolic homeostasis of their host. The synonymous term microbiome describes either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that reside in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves.

The microbiome and host emerged during evolution as a synergistic unit from epigenetics and genomic characteristics, sometimes collectively referred to as a holobiont.

To take part I'd recommend submitting a text post with your age, sex and location. 
Example, **Mary, Female. 20, NY.** Something like that will do, as long as it includes the basic info it's cool.

1. Sex chat of any kind will not be tolerated, if you're lucky enough to hit it off with someone that quickly continue the chat privately.

2. Don't be a creep.

Flag your NSFW posts (NSFW does not mean you get to post tiddy and bussy to a subreddit full of teenagers). If you don't know how to do that, fuck you. Automod will do it for you after someone comments if you use the appropriate flair, and speaking of:

**Either use our flairs correctly or to be exceptionally funny.**

Otherwise, our unwritten rules are mostly a vibe check. If you don't pass the vibe check we'll probably call you a nerd. Extremely uncool behavior will probably get you a brickin' (ban).

If you post in certain subreddits you've most likely already failed the vibe check. Context clues below should help you figure out which ones, so without further ado if you still don't know what the vibe check entails, this subreddit is:

✅ ACAB (and we especially mean the one you know personally)

✅ Antifascist

✅ BLM

✅ LGBTQIA+ and allies

✅ Trans rights (it's one of our default flairs!)

✅ Full of femboys and bottom energy tbh

❌ Bigots

❌ Bootlickers

❌ Conservatives

❌ Cops (we hate cops so goddamn much it's unreal)

❌ Landlords

❌ Nazis

❌ Tankies

❌ Tate, Peterson, Rogan, et al., as well as their defenders and downplayers

❌ The French (this is mostly a joke)

Yes, this IS a safe space and failure to pass this vibe check will absolutely result in a permanent ban. We don't care for your devil's advocacy or JAQing off, and we look forward to your inevitable post bitching about us on justunsubbed.

#### What is Peercoin?
Peercoin is an efficient and sustainable, green cryptocurrency based on continuous limited inflation. It is the original pioneer of Proof of Stake.

#### Overview
1. Launch & Initial Distribution
 * **Launch:** The Peercoin blockchain was originally [launched](https://bit.ly/3fGLn32) on August 19th, 2012 by developers Sunny King and Scott Nadal, with no initial coin offering, premine, or developer tax. The project is completely open source and community driven.
 * **Initial Distribution:** Peercoin was the first of its kind, a blockchain secured by Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, however Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining was originally used to fairly distribute the initial coin supply. Although it is decreasing in importance over time, PoW mining continues to provide a trickle of fresh coins. This has the effect of slowly decentralizing the blockchain over time by getting coins into the hands of new owners who can help secure the network via PoS minting.
2. Efficient & Sustainable Security
 * **Time as a Scarce Resource:** The key innovation of Peercoin is its invention of PoS. PoW blockchains are secured by proving the consumption of a costly resource: electricity. PoS replaces this expensive security protocol by using an alternative scarce resource: time. The older your coins are, the more time they’ve accumulated sitting in your wallet, which gives them more power to participate in securing the network.
 * **Security with Low Power Devices:** With PoS, you only need enough power to run your computer or laptop. This is possible because the network is secured through ownership of peercoins and the time they sit idle in your wallet, not by the wasteful and costly operation of mining equipment. This efficiency helps grow the number of security providers by making it more affordable to participate. Almost a decade after its launch, Peercoin continues to prove that energy efficient blockchain security is possible.
3. Benefits of Proof of Stake
 * **Aligning Security with Ownership:** In PoW networks, miners can easily jump between whichever network is more profitable to mine, without any loyalty. In Peercoin however, the responsibility for security falls to the coin owners themselves, guaranteeing stakeholders have a vested interest in maintaining the network’s security.
 * **Geographical Decentralization:** PoW mining concentrates power where electricity is cheapest, which compromises security, making it easier for local governments to target miners. By contrast, PoS minting can be done anywhere.
 * **Price Independent Security:** Unlike PoW miners, who rely on a positive asset price to cover their costs of operation and remain profitable, Peercoin minters benefit from the efficiency and lower costs of PoS. As a result, PoS minters are independent of price and can always secure the network with little expense to them.
 * **User Governance:** Protocol rules are governed collectively by Peercoin’s users, making for a more democratic network.
4. Limited Inflation Economics
 * **Continuous Limited Inflation:** Many in crypto have a negative view toward inflation, resulting in the popularization of “deflationary,” fixed-supply economic models. At Peercoin however, inflation is viewed as a necessary element that contributes to the proper functioning of an economy. The problem stems from centrally controlled inflation, which can be excessive due to manipulation. The solution is not eliminating inflation entirely, but limiting and decentralizing it. This is the principle at the heart of Peercoin’s economic model, which targets an annual supply increase of around 2-3%. This mild inflation encourages circulation by providing a regulated and continuous stream of new coins into the hands of decentralized participants. As a counterbalance, transaction fees are burned, which acts as a downward force on the supply.
 * **Permanent Subsidy** This annual inflation allows the Peercoin network to subsidize block producers with new coins, completely eliminating their reliance on transaction fees. The subsidy provides a permanent incentive for stakeholders to continuously produce new blocks. Personal minting rewards can range anywhere from 3% for periodic minters to 5% for continuous minters.
5. Trustless Settlement Layer
 * **Immutable Record Keeping:** At its essence, a blockchain is a fully verifiable distributed public ledger which records data in a manner that prevents alterations. This tamper-proof system ensures stored data is immutable and requires less trust from users than third party intermediaries. The blockchain’s strength is primarily in permanent record keeping, rather than being used as a tool for daily payments. Transactions on the chain can be slow and expensive. This is solved with vertical and horizontal scaling technology, which offloads transactions onto separate off-chain networks built for high capacity processing. The blockchain plays the role of settlement layer by permanently recording the final result of these off-chain transactions.
 * **Built for Trustless Settlement:** Blockchains that draw their security from transaction fees however are directly competing with the node operators of these off-chain networks. Fighting with off-chain nodes over the same fees is an incompatibility that will only starve block producers of potential revenue, resulting in reduced security for the blockchain. Since Peercoin is secured without any reliance on transaction fees, it is in complete alignment with off-chain networks, making it a better alternative to serve the role of a trustless settlement layer.
6. Development Roadmap
 * Full details can be found [here](https://bit.ly/3rQpTDe). The following is a brief summary of Peercoin's 2021 roadmap.
 * **Core Development**
 * **v0.10 - Codename: Scarab:**
 * New codebase (based on bitcoin-core 0.20)
 * **v0.11 - Codename: Tardigrade:**
 * [RFC-0012](https://bit.ly/3wtc4yk) (Cold minting)
 * [RFC-0014](https://github.com/peercoin/rfcs/blob/master/text/0014-transaction-timestamp/0014-transaction-timestamp.md) (Removal of the transaction timestamp for non-coinstake transactions)
 * [RFC-0020](https://bit.ly/3mloHqh) (Proof-of-Work Difficulty on PoS Blocks)
 * **Non-Core Development**
 * Peercoin <-> Ethereum Bridge
 * Android/iOS Mobile Apps
 * Rosetta Integration
 * **Donate:** These developments are sponsored by the Peercoin Foundation, which in turn is sponsored by generous community donations. PPC, BTC, and fiat can be donated at [peercoin.net/foundation](https://bit.ly/3fEq3eH).

**About CSP**



* People with CSP feel compelled to pick at real or perceived blemishes (acne, dry skin, callouses, or other textural anomalies); resisting these urges is akin to resisting the urge to cough or to scratch an itch.

* CSP is an Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorder, and  sometimes also referred to as dermatillomania.  In the DSM-5, it is called ""Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder"".

* Engaging in these compulsions can lead to pain, infections, scarring, and social stigma, as well as feelings of shame, guilt, and depression.

* Treatments exist for CSP, and they involve hard work in therapy aimed at reducing the frequency and duration of picking episodes. Medications may help, but there are no cures.

**RULES**:

**1**.Always be kind and considerate.

*Here are some tips:*  
- *Think before you type.*  
- *Consider the true intention of your words.*  
- *Assume others' intentions are positive.*  
- *Assume any unkindness you find is because someone has had a bad day.*  
- *Welcome dissent and assume it's constructive.*  
- *Welcome different ways of speaking beside your own.*  
- *If you make a mistake, own up to it.*  
- *If you're unsure if you should post, give it another day.*  
- *If you're still unsure, don't post.*

*This community has 0 tolerance for discrimination, regardless of whether the person facing moderation believes the subject is political or up for debate. Discriminatory posts/comments will be moderated according to rule 3.*

*Posts that are controversial will be moderated more heavily for this rule.*

**2**.Observe the Social Model of Disability.

*The model explains that a person is only disabled by barriers society created. Thus it's society's obligation to remove the barriers to create a more equal society for everyone, not just its 'typical' members.*

*It isn't a perfect model for how society should consider the neurodiverse, but it does instruct us not to suggest a person's difficulties are only theirs to overcome. Do encourage others to communicate with the people around them.*

*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability*

**3**.Is this post right for r/autismUK?

*You should use your best judgement to decide if your posts are suitable for the community. Moderators will do the same to decide whether your post is acceptable.*

*This should be a common sense judgment in most cases, but where you are not sure, you will want to lean toward caution when deciding. You are welcome to message the moderators for advice.*

*Some examples of inappropriate posts:* 
- *discussions of pseudo-science, or 'cures'* 
- *discrimination of any kind* 
- *links to blogs whose purpose is to get you to use their affiliate links* 
- *using sources which are heavily biased or discriminatory*
- *using sources whose facts cannot be proved or are disproved*

What will happen to posts that are moderated for this rule? 

*In many cases, the post will be locked, all comments deleted, and the post's flair will be changed to reflect what is inappropriate about the post. This is to help educate the community, it is not a reflection of any attitude toward the poster themself. An explanation for how the post is inappropriate will be left in the comments.*

*New types of inappropriate posts will be recorded on a wiki page.*

*Posts that are not kept for education purposes, and all comments, will be deleted.*

**4**.Self Promotion

*Self-promotion is not permitted unless you can demonstrate that you are an active participant in the community. This means you must use text posts to self-promote and you can only post your promotion in the comment. Text posts require a minimum of 500 characters to post.*

*Self-promoters breaking this rule will have their posts deleted and the URLs from their links blacklisted from post content.*
 
Why? 

*Because the UK's autistic population isn't here to provide you with likes, subs, or karma. We understand that making your work can be a valid way of processing your life experience and a means of passing on your hard-won insights, but when you aren't an active member of the community it makes us feel used, targetted, and harassed.* 
 
*We do understand that it's not easy for all our members to be verbose, but in order to require self-promoters to participate, we have to require the minimum limit for everyone.*

571,True,raisedbyautistics,For the children of autistic parents,r/raisedbyautistics,828,t5_3ccgb,This is a subreddit for people raised by an autistic parent. ,False,1454768626.0,restricted,3ccgb,False,,"This subreddit is a group for people raised by an autistic parent and is intended to help find information, resources and fellow children of autistics.

At the core of autism are theory of mind impairments (mind-blindness), meaning people with autism have varying difficulty interpreting other people's emotional states. (See also [Mind Blindness and the Brain in Autism](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyautistics/comments/45jd4d/mind_blindness_and_the_brain_in_autism/))

As a child, you are dependent on your parent being able to interpret your emotional state. When you are pre-verbal as well as when you are very young. You need your parent to help you, soothe you, support and socialize you. 

**Healthy families**

In healthy families, where a parent has autism, the parent often understands that he or she has limitations. He or she generally knows and accepts that there are things (s)he is not good at, and will generally receive support from non-autistic adults, like their spouse, to help compensate for their deficits. Both the autistic partner and non-autistic spouse communicate well, despite neurological differences, and the family is gererally very loving and happy. Children of autistic parents from healthy families generally discover later in life that their parent was struggling and may have some difficulties connecting with their parent at times, but in general look back on a loving, if a little weird, childhood. 

**Dysfunctional families**

In dysfunctional families, where a parent has autism, the parent either does not understand or refuses to acknowledge that he or she has limitations. Both partners in the relationship tend to blame the other for difficulties. There is a lot of fighting and children feel unloved and unsupported. Many children feel at a young age that something is 'wrong'. Often they discover autism later in life and struggle with immense loneliness. In these families, the child is unseen and unsupported, because the parents are too busy fighting to get themselves heard, without listening to the other person. If there are circumstances contributing to a dysfunctional family dynamic, there can be (unintended but real and often significant) emotional and psychological damage to the child. Need to vent, want to know if someone else experienced the same or wish to understand more about what autism means for your family? This can hopefully become the place to do that..

**Average**

Somewhere in the middle are functioning, but generally emotionally very empty families. Children from these families struggle with having had a 'decent' upbringing, but feeling very, very lonely. Depression is a common mental health issue.

**Dealing with grief and anger and finding mutual understanding**

Children from these three family dynamics have very different experiences and very different views of autism. For children from dysfunctional families, often there is heavy trauma and complicated grief that hardly dissipates with time. For children from both dysfunctional and 'average' family, there is often an intense feeling of loneliness. There is furthermore a lot of anger at never having been seen or heard as a child. 

If we do not deal with this grief we lump all autistic people in a bin and project all our anger on all autistic people. For people coming from healthy, loving families, this may be very difficult to see happening. Please understand that this is often part of the grieving process. 

If you come from a loving family and want to help, please share your stories.

[](/sidebar)

 Savant is the dubstep/complextro alias of the Norwegian artist Aleksander
Vinter.  


He is a prodigious savant with Asperger's syndrome and a fracture of ADD. He
thinks out songs in seconds and produces them within few hours. 
To this date
Aleksander has composed/produced over 10,000 songs in various genres, most
notably metal, orchestral/classical, hip-hop and electronic music. Aleksander
also draws inspiration from early game music such as NES, Sega, Commodore 64,
Amiga, Atari and SNES. Being such a unique producer; open minded people embrace
him and the weekly free music, though critics tend to critique the quantity and
the fast rate of releases. 


In 2009, he released his debut album, *Outbreak*, under the Vinter in Hollywood
alias. Outbreak was nominated in the electronic music category for the 2009
Norwegian Grammy Awards. 


Vinter signed with SectionZ Records in 2010 and released *Mamachine* under the
alias Vinter in Vegas and in 2011, *Ninür* under Savant. 

2012 was his most prolific year in terms of full projects: *Vario*, *Overworld*, *ISM* and *Alchemist* all contain over 12 tracks each, and represent Savant's first boom in popularity.
Starting from *Vario*, no record would shy away from Bandcamp's #1 spot.

In 2013, his following increased as he embarked on two North American tours.
Between tours he released the album *Cult* and provided music for the D-Pad
Studio game Savant – Ascent. *Orakel* was released on December 11, 2013 and
reached the #3 spot on the iTunes Dance charts in the US. 

In 2014, Savant released *Protos*, which reached #24 on the North American
iTunes Pop charts and #1 on the Bandcamp Electronica and Overall charts. Later
that year, on December 13, 2014, *Zion* was released, peaking at #2 on the
holiday iTunes Dance chart in the US. *Zion* also reached #19 on the Billboard
Dance chart and #24 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. 

*Invasion* was released in January 2015, and led deadmau5 to call
Savant “the change that electronic dance music needs”.
He also released the *Bajo EP* under his old alias of Blanco, mixing ""Latin, African, Arabic, European and Asian music"".

In 2016 Vinter worked on singles for the highly anticipated Vex. These are: *Fire*, *Cassette*, *Savior* and *Forsaken*. *Get It Get It*, featuring DMX and Snoop Dogg, is his standalone single for 2016. Later that year *Vybz* came out again under Savant, as well as a semi-unmastered collection of unreleased tracks called *Outcasts*.

In 2017, he brought back his old hip-hop alias: Datakrash, with the release of the *Savage EP* and the *90's Babies* collab with co-label artist and friend, ToBy. Along with the reactivation of his SoundCloud page, Vinter is offered to work on the soundtrack for *The Black Room*, a film directed by Rolfe Kanefsky. The OST was released on Savant's bandcamp page on March 11.
Following this, he also put out a Savant record called *Jester*, reaching #1 on Bandcamp once again.
In the latter months of 2017, Aleks resurrected yet another alias, ""Vinter"", releasing the single *Online*.

In 2018, Aleks is offered to work on the soundtrack of a still unnamed ""Savant RPG"" game.
He also released a celtic-inspired record called *Highlander* under his own name in March and remastered *Jester* shortly after.

Please use reddit's voting system to your advantage. Upvote what you want to see, downvote what you want to hide.

",True,1201272238.0,public,2qh65,False,,"Have a burning question? Need some opinions? /r/polls is a subreddit dedicated to simple and quick polls.

Do you want to create a poll?  Please use Reddit to create a poll on https://new.reddit.com/r/polls or with the official Reddit app.

## [Filter out politics](https://old.reddit.com/r/polls/search/?q=-flair%3APolitics&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=day&sort=top#res-hide-options) 

### [Posting Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/polls/about/rules)

1. **Post must be a [poll](https://tinyurl.com/polldef).** Your post must contain an active poll that users can vote on. Using the upvote/downvote system as a form of voting is not allowed. [^(note)](https://old.reddit.com/r/polls/wiki/rules/rule-1/note-1)

2. **Be respectful.** [See more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/polls/comments/vj2bjd/we_dont_tolerate_bigotry/). Hate speech (racism, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, ableism, etc.) will not be tolerated and will result in a permanent ban. This includes polls with disrespectful or hateful options. Additionally, do not personally attack other users or make inflammatory comments against others.

3. **Posts must have a clear and direct question of the poll in the title and specify the demographic they're for.** You are welcome to elaborate on the question in the post body.  If your poll is for all demographics, make sure that you provide enough context for anyone to answer.

4. **Flair your post correctly.** Make sure that the flair you've chosen fits the subject of your poll. The ""Other"" flair should **only** be used if no other flair matches the topic of your poll.

5. **Do not metabait.** An example of metabaiting would be asking people to upvote a poll.

6. **Do not post NSFW content.** We do not allow for NSFW content, poll or otherwise.  Exceptionally creepy content may fall under this rule as well at moderator discretion.

7. **Do not push specific agendas or post loaded questions.** Do not manipulate users into following an agenda through polls. This includes [loaded questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question) and insinuating that one option is the “correct” one.

8. **Do not post polls that were already posted in the last week, are on [our Frequently Reposted Polls list](https://old.reddit.com/r/polls/wiki/index) or are in the [top 25 polls of last month](/r/polls/top/?t=month).** If the poll you're trying to make fails to meet the above requirements, it will be removed.

9. **Limit yourself to 5 posts per 24 hours.** If you make more than that, every post after the threshold will be automatically removed until you're eligible to post again. This includes using alternate accounts.

*We're trying to keep our rules in sync across all platforms, but we might miss a thing or two. You can always view the most up-to-date rules at the [rules page](https://old.reddit.com/r/polls/about/rules).*
