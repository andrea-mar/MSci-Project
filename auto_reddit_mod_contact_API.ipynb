    "The following code is using Reddit API to contact the moderators of subreddits. However the API does not work for private subreddits ()\n",
    "\n",
    "Many subreddits have gone private this year (summer 2023) in protest of Reddit adding charges to the commercial use of their API (https://mobilewirelesstrends.com/apps/why-are-subreddits-going-private/). This might be a reason for why the subreddits in my list have been set to private. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to contact the moderators of private subreddits, is via the url (for ex: https://www.reddit.com//r/asd/). This can only be done in the browser. This will lead to a page where it is stated that the subreddit ( ex. r/asd ) is a private community, and an option to contact the moderators is available. If this button ( contact the moderators ) is clicked, the user is sent to a new page/url where there is a form field with a subject input and a message input ( up to this point the process of accessing the subreddit's page, clicking on contact the moderators and filling in the subject and message in the form , can be automated using Python and  Selenium ). After these, there is a Captcha tick box ( this cannot be automated ) and after this Captcha has been clicked and confirmed user is not a bot, the message can be sent. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will thus automate the first part of the process for all the private subreddits ( using Selenium - https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/). After the message is filled in, I will need to manually click the Captcha and send the message.  - see script in auto_reddit_mod_contact_selenium.ipynb"

       "\"Hello, \\n\\nMy name is Andreea, and I am a data science master's student at Birkbeck College, University of London. My thesis research focuses on prevalent discussion themes within autism Reddit communities. In particular, I'm planning to track the frequency of specific keywords linked to Applied Behavioural Analysis and assess the overall sentiment of discussions revolving around this topic. My aim is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the autism community perceives Applied Behavioural Analysis. I am reaching out to respectfully request permission to join and access the discussions in your private subreddit. \\n\\nI understand how crucial privacy and security are in your community, and thus I am committed to maintaining the anonymity and confidentiality of all members. The information gathered will be used strictly for academic purposes. \\n\\nIn recognition of the trust and sensitivity associated with your community's discussions, I am more than willing to adhere to any guidelines, rules, or protocols that you might have in place for granting access to external researchers. Whether that involves submitting a formal proposal, adhering to ethical guidelines, or any other necessary steps, I am completely open to the process.\\n\\nMoreover, I promise to share a comprehensive summary of my findings with the subreddit once my research is complete. This way, the community will benefit from the outcomes of my study.\\n\\nFor your reference, my thesis supervisor is Dimitrios Airantzis. He can be reached at dimitris.airantzis@bbk.ac.uk, in case you require any additional information or reassurance.\\n\\nThank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of joining your community.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\n\\nAndreea Nistor\\n\\nEmail: anisto01@student.bbk.ac.uk\""
